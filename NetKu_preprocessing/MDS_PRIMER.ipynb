[KEEP] As of 15 July, over a third of Afghanistans 421 districts were controlled by the Taliban, and by 21 July, half of Afghanistan was under Taliban control. [KEEP] During the Afghan Civil War (1996–2001), resistance to the Taliban was strongest in northern Afghanistan, the base of the Northern Alliance. [ADD] According to the Afghanistan Analysts Network, the Talibans concentration of its forces in the north may be an attempt to forestall the creation of a second Northern Alliance after the withdrawal of U.S. forces. [KEEP] In May, the Taliban captured 15 districts from the Afghan government, including Nirkh and Jalrez districts in Maidan Wardak Province. [KEEP] Among the locations captured was the Dahla Dam in Kandahar Province, Afghanistans second largest dam. [KEEP] During the month, 405 Afghan National Security Forces and 260 civilians were killed during the clashes with the Taliban, while the Afghan Ministry of Defense claimed killing 2,146 Taliban fighters. [KEEP] By the end of May, Portugal, Slovenia, Spain, and Sweden had completely withdrawn their forces from Afghanistan. [KEEP] In June, the Taliban captured 69 districts from the Afghan government and entered the cities of Kunduz and Puli Khumri. [KEEP] The city of Mazar-i-Sharif was besieged by Taliban. [KEEP] Among the locations captured by Taliban was Afghanistans main border crossing with Tajikistan and the Saydabad District in Maidan Wardak Province, which is called the gateway of Afghanistans capital city Kabul. [KEEP] In terms of equipment the Taliban captured 700 trucks and Humvees from the Afghan security forces as well as dozens of armored vehicles and artillery systems. [KEEP] An Afghan Air Force Mil Mi-17 was shot down by the Taliban, killing three pilots, while a UH-60 Black Hawk was damaged on ground after an outpost belonging to the Afghan Armed Forces was shelled by the Taliban in the same month.

Some provinces have asked local municipal governments, hospital systems, family doctors and independently owned pharmacies to aid in part, or in full with vaccination rollout. The vaccination effort in full is the largest such immunization effort in the nation's history; it started in mid-December and is currently ongoing In Canada, Health Canada is responsible for approval and regulation of vaccines (and other pharmaceuticals), while the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC) is responsible for public health, emergency preparedness and response, and infectious and chronic disease control and prevention. Vaccines are approved by Health Canada, purchased by the Government of Canada and distributed by PHAC to individual provinces and territories in tranches based on various factors such as population size and prioritized peoples. The National Advisory Committee on Immunization (NACI) has also issued recommendations on how vaccines should be distributed From about mid-January until mid-February, both Pfizer–BioNTech and Moderna did not ship the agreed upon quantities of secured vaccines to Canada and other countries, due to manufacturing challenges. By February 18, Major General Dany Fortin, who led vaccine logistics at the Public Health Agency of Canada (PHAC),  announced that the vaccine delivery was back on track and that there will now be an abundance of supplies which will result in a significant scaling-up of immunization plans in provinces. Significant increases in manufacturing and delivery of vaccines in conjunction with a recommendation by NACI to extend second dose administration to a maximum of 16 weeks resulted in a larger ramp-up in vaccine delivery across the nation in March - June 2021. By July 2021, Canada's vaccine supply had grown to allow a return to shortened dose intervals With Health Canada approving the Pfizer–BioNTech COVID-19 vaccine on December 9, 2020, mass vaccination efforts began across the country on December 14, 2020. The agency later approved the mRNA-1273 vaccine developed by Moderna on December 23, 2020 On February 26, 2021, Health Canada approved the Oxford–AstraZeneca vaccine for use, and its first shipments arrived in Canada on March 3, 2021. Following concerns of blood clotting events, although continuing to be approved, the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine has been largely discontinued as a first dose, and those who had already received a first dose are encouraged to receive an mRNA vaccine as their second. The Janssen vaccine was approved on March 5, 2021, to become the fourth vaccine to receive Health Canada approval; However, Canada did not receive a delivery of the Johnson & Johnson vaccine until April 28, 2021; which was then destroyed due to contamination issues at its factory of origin.

As the leader of the Bolivarian Revolution, Chávez promotes his vision of democratic socialism, Latin American integration, and anti-imperialism.  He is also an ardent critic of neoliberal globalization and  US foreign policy.\\\\c\\\\cA career military officer, Chávez founded the leftist Fifth Republic Movement after orchestrating a failed 1992 coup d\\\\état against former president Carlos Andrés Pérez.  Chávez was elected President in 1998 on promises of aiding Venezuela\\\\s poor majority, and was reelected in 2000. Domestically, Chávez has launched massive Bolivarian Missions, whose goals are to combat disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, poverty, and other social ills. Abroad, Chávez has acted against the Washington Consensus by supporting alternative models of economic development, and has advocated cooperation among the world\\\\s poor nations, especially those in Latin America.\\\\c\\\\cChávez\\\\s reforms have evoked exceptional controversy in Venezuela and abroad, receiving both criticism and praise. Venezuelans are split between those who say he has empowered the poor and stimulated economic growth, and those who say he is autocratic and has mismanaged the economy. Some foreign governments view Chávez as a threat to global oil prices and regional stability, while others welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements\\\\c\\\\cIn May 2006, he was named one of Time magazine\\\\s 100 most influential people.\\\\c\\\\cChávez was born on July 28, 1954 in the town of Sabaneta, Barinas. The second son of two schoolteachers, Hugo de los Reyes Chávez and Elena Frías de Chávez, he is of mixed  Amerindian, African, and Spanish descent. Chávez was raised in a thatched palm leaf house near Sabaneta. At an early age, Chávez was sent to Sabaneta with his older brother Adán to live with his paternal grandmother, Rosa Inés Chávez. There, Chávez pursued hobbies such as painting, singing, and baseball, while also attending elementary school at the Julián Pino School. He was later forced to relocate to the town of Barinas to attend high school at the Daniel Florencio O\\\\Leary School\\\\c\\\\cAt age seventeen, Chávez enrolled at the Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences. After graduating in 1975 as a sub-lieutenant with a degree in Military Arts and Science, Chávez entered military service for several months. He was then allowed to pursue graduate studies in political science at Caracas\\\\ Simón Bolívar University, but left without a degree\\\\c\\\\cOver the course of his college years, Chávez and fellow students developed a fervently left-nationalist doctrine that they termed Bolivarianism, inspired by the Pan-Americanist philosophies of 19th-century Venezuelan revolutionary Simón Bolívar, the influence of former Peruvian President Juan Velasco Alvarado and the teachings of various socialist and communist leaders. Chávez engaged in sporting events and cultural activities during these years as well. Notably, Chávez played both baseball and softball with the Criollitos de Venezuela, progressing with them to the Venezuelan National Baseball Championships in 1969. Chávez also authored numerous poems, stories and theatrical pieces.\\\\c\\\\cUpon completing his studies, Chávez initially entered active-duty military service as a member of a counter insurgency battalion stationed in Barinas. Chávez\\\\s military career lasted 17 years, during which time he held a variety of post, command, and staff positions, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Chávez also held a series of teaching and staffing positions at the Military Academy of Venezuela, where he was first acknowledged by his peers for his fiery lecturing style and radical critique of Venezuelan government and society. At this time, Chávez established the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200). Afterwards, he rose to fill a number of sensitive high-level positions in Caracas and was decorated several times.\\\\c\\\\cAfter an extended period of popular dissatisfaction and economic decline under the administration of President Carlos Andrés Pérez and the violent repression known as El Caracazo,  Chávez made extensive preparations for a military coup d\\\\état. Initially planned for December, Chávez delayed the MBR-200 coup until the early twilight hours of February 4, 1992. On that date, five army units under Chávez\\\\s command barreled into urban Caracas with the mission of assaulting and overwhelming key military and communications installations throughout the city, including the Miraflores presidential palace, the defense ministry, La Carlota military airport, and the Historical Museum. Chávez\\\\s ultimate goal was to intercept and take custody of Pérez, who was returning to Miraflores from an overseas trip\\\\c\\\\cChávez held the loyalty of less than 10% of Venezuela\\\\s military forces; still, numerous betrayals, defections, errors, and other unforeseen circumstances soon left Chávez and a small group of rebels cut off in the Historical Museum, without any means of conveying orders to their network of spies and collaborators spread throughout Venezuela. Further, Chávez\\\\s allies were unable to broadcast their prerecorded tapes on the national airwaves in which Chávez planned to issue a general call for a mass civilian uprising against Pérez. As the coup unfolded, the coup plotters were unable to capture Pérez: fourteen soldiers were killed, and 50 soldiers and some 80 civilians injured in the ensuing violence.  Nevertheless, rebel forces in other parts of Venezuela made advances and were ultimately able to take control of such large cities as Valencia, Maracaibo, and Maracay with the help of spontaneous civilian aid. Chávez\\\\s forces, however, had failed to take Caracas.\\\\c\\\\cChávez, alarmed, soon gave himself up to the government. He was then allowed to appear on national television to call for all remaining rebel detachments in Venezuela to cease hostilities. When he did so, Chávez famously quipped on national television that he had only failed por ahora—for the moment. Chávez was catapulted into the national spotlight, with many poor Venezuelans seeing him as a figure who had stood up against government corruption and kleptocracy.  Chávez was sent to Yare prison; meanwhile, Pérez, the coup\\\\s intended target, was impeached a year later. While in prison, Chávez developed a carnosity of the eye, which spread to his iris. The clarity of his eyesight was slowly corrupted; despite treatments and operations, Chávez\\\\s eyesight was permanently damaged\\\\c\\\\cTemplate:ChavezElections1998\\\\c\\\\cAfter a two-year imprisonment, Chávez was pardoned by President Rafael Caldera in 1994. Upon his release, Chávez reconstituted the MBR-200 as the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR—Movimiento Quinta República, with the V representing the Roman numeral five). Later, in 1998, Chávez began to campaign for the presidency. In working to gain the trust of voters, Chávez drafted an agenda that drew heavily on his ideology of Bolivarianism. Chávez and his followers described their aim as laying the foundations of a new republic to replace the existing one, which they cast as party-dominated; the current constitution, they argued, was no more than the \\\\juridico-political embodiment of puntofijismo,\\\\ the country\\\\s traditional two-party patronage system. Controversially, foreign banks—including Spain\\\\s Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) and Banco Santander (BSCH), each the owner of one of Venezuela\\\\s largest banks—illicitly funneled millions of dollars into Chávez\\\\s campaign.\\\\c\\\\cChávez utilized his charisma and flamboyant public speaking style—noted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manner—on the campaign trail to win the trust and favor of a primarily poor and working class following. By May 1998, Chávez\\\\s support had risen to 30% in polls, and by August he was registering 39%. Chávez went on to win the Carter Center-endorsed 1998 presidential election on December 6, 1998 with 56% of the vote.\\\\c\\\\cChávez took the presidential oath of office on February 2, 1999 with a mandate to reverse Venezuela\\\\s economic decline and strengthen the role of the state in the economy. Chávez\\\\s first few months in office were dedicated primarily to dismantling what his supporters deemed puntofijismo via new legislation and constitutional reform, while his secondary focus was on immediately allocating more government funds to new social programs.\\\\c\\\\cHowever, as a recession triggered by historically low oil prices and soaring international interest rates rocked Venezuela, the shrunken federal treasury provided very little of the resources Chávez required for his promised massive anti-poverty measures. Consequently, in April 1999 Chávez set his eyes upon the one Venezuelan institution that was costly for the government but did little for the systematic social development that Chávez desired: the military. Chávez ordered all branches of the military to devise programs to combat poverty and to further civic and social development in Venezuela\\\\s vast slum and rural areas. This civilian-military program was launched as Plan Bolivar 2000, whose scope included road building, housing construction, and mass vaccination. The plan faltered at the end of 2001 amid revelations of corruption by military officers, including both military officers who later rebelled against the president in April 2002 and officers linked to the president.\\\\c\\\\cChávez sharply diverged from previous administrations\\\\ economic policies, terminating their practice of extensively privatizing Venezuela\\\\s state-owned holdings, such as the national social security system, holdings in the aluminum industry, and the oil sector.[citation needed] However, although Chávez wished to promote the redistribution of wealth, increased regulation, and social spending, he did not wish to discourage foreign direct investment (FDI). In keeping with his predecessors, Chávez attempted to shore up FDI influxes to prevent an economic crisis of chronic capital flight and inflation.\\\\c\\\\cChávez also worked to reduce Venezuelan oil extraction in the hopes of elevating oil prices and, at least theoretically, elevated total oil revenues, thereby boosting Venezuela\\\\s severely deflated foreign exchange reserves. He extensively lobbied other OPEC countries to cut their production rates as well. As a result of these actions, Chávez became known as a price hawk in his dealings with the oil industry and OPEC. Chávez also attempted a comprehensive renegotiation of 60-year-old royalty payment agreements with oil giants Philips Petroleum and ExxonMobil. These agreements had allowed the corporations to pay in taxes as little as 1% of the tens of billions of dollars in revenues they were earning from the Venezuelan oil they were extracting. Afterwards, Chávez stated his intention to complete the nationalization of Venezuela\\\\s oil resources. Although unsuccessful in his attempts to renegotiate with the oil corporations, Chávez focused on his stated goal of improving both the fairness and efficiency of Venezuela\\\\s formerly lax tax collection and auditing system, especially for major corporations and landholders.\\\\c\\\\cTemplate:ChavezElections1999\\\\c\\\\cNevertheless, by mid-1999, Chávez was incensed by his administration\\\\s setbacks in enacting his much-promised anti-poverty initiatives. The National Assembly\\\\s opposition members impeded the legislation of his political allies. Chávez moved to bypass such opposition by approving the scheduling of two fresh national elections for July 1999—just months after Chávez\\\\s presidential election. The first was a nationwide referendum to determine whether a national constitutional assembly should be created. The assembly was tasked with framing a new Venezuelan constitution that hewed more closely to Chávez\\\\s own political ideology. A second election was held that elected delegates to this constitutional assembly. The constitutional referendum passed with a CNE-audited 72% yes vote; in the second election, members of Chávez\\\\s MVR and select allied parties formed the Polo Patriotico (Patriotic Pole). Chávez\\\\s Polo Patriotico went on to win 95% (120 out of the total 131) of the seats in the voter-approved Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly.\\\\c\\\\cHowever, in August 1999, the Constitutional Assembly established a special judicial emergency committee with the power to remove judges without consulting with other branches of government—over 190 judges were eventually suspended on charges of corruption. In the same month, the Constitutional Assembly declared a legislative emergency, resulting in a seven-member committee that was tasked with conducting the legislative functions ordinarily carried out by the National Assembly. Legislative opposition to Chávez\\\\s policies was immediately disabled. Meanwhile, the Constitutional Assembly prohibited the National Assembly from holding meetings of any sort.\\\\c\\\\cThe Constitutional Assembly itself drafted the new 1999 Venezuelan Constitution. With 350 articles, the document was, as drafted, one of the world\\\\s lengthiest constitutions. It first changed the country\\\\s official name from Republic of Venezuela to Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.  It also increased the presidential term of office from five to six years, allowed for two consecutive presidential terms rather than one, introduced a presidential two-term limit, and introduced provisions for national presidential recall referenda—that is, Venezuelan voters gained the right to remove the president from office before the expiration of his presidential term.  Such referenda can only be activated by a petition to do so with the required number of signatures. The presidency was also dramatically strengthened, with the power to dissolve the National Assembly on certain conditions. The new constitution converted the formerly bicameral National Assembly into a unicameral legislature, and stripped it of many of its former powers. Provisions were also made for a new position, the Public Defender, an office with the authority to check the activities of the presidency, the National Assembly, and the constitution. Chávez characterized the Public Defender as the guardian of the moral branch of the new Venezuelan government, tasked with defending public and moral interests. Lastly, the Venezuelan judiciary was reformed. Judges, under the new constitution, were now to be installed after passing public examinations and were not, as in the old manner, to be appointed by the National Assembly.\\\\c\\\\cThis new constitution was presented to the national electorate in December 1999 and approved. Over a span of a mere 60 days, the Constitutional Assembly thus framed a document that enshrined as constitutional law most of the structural changes Chávez desired. Chávez stated that such changes were necessary in order to successfully and comprehensively enact his planned social justice programs. He planned to enact sweeping changes in Venezuelan governmental and political structure, and, based on his 1998 campaign pledges, to dramatically open up Venezuelan political discourse to independent and third parties. In the process, Chávez sought to fatally paralyze his AD (Acción Democrática) and COPEI opposition. All of Chávez\\\\s aims were, in one move, dramatically furthered\\\\c\\\\cOn December 15 1999, after weeks of heavy rain, statewide mudslides claimed the lives of an estimated 30,000 people. Critics claim Chávez was distracted by the referendum and that the government ignored a civil defense report, calling for emergency measures, issued the day the floods struck. The government rejected these claims. Chávez personally led the relief effort afterwards. Subsequent mudslides in 2000 left 3 dead.\\\\c\\\\cTemplate:ChavezElections2000\\\\c\\\\cElections for the new unicameral National Assembly were held on July 30, 2000. During this same election, Chávez himself stood for reelection. Chávez\\\\s coalition garnered a commanding two-thirds majority of seats in the National Assembly while Chávez was reelected with 60% of the votes. The Carter Center monitored the 2000 presidential election; their report on that election stated that, due to lack of transparency, CNE partiality, and political pressure from the Chávez government that resulted in unconstitutionally early elections, it was unable to validate the official CNE results. However, they concluded that the presidential election legitimately expressed the will of the people.\\\\c\\\\cLater, on December 3, 2000, local elections and a referendum were held. The referendum, backed by Chávez, proposed a law that would force Venezuela\\\\s labor unions to hold state-monitored elections.  The referendum was widely condemned by international labor organizations—including the International Labour Organization—as undue government interference in internal union matters; these organizations threatened to apply sanctions on Venezuela.\\\\c\\\\cAfter the May and July 2000 elections, Chávez backed the passage of the Enabling Act by the National Assembly. This act allowed Chávez to rule by decree for one year. In November 2001, shortly before the Enabling Act was set to expire, Chávez enacted a set of 49 decrees. These included the Hydrocarbons Law and the Land Law, which are detailed below. Fedecámaras, a national business federation,and the Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela, a federation of labor unions, opposed the approval of the new laws and called for a general business strike on December 10, 2001 in the hope that the President would reconsider his legislative action and, instead, open a debate about those laws. The strike failed to significantly impact Chávez\\\\s decision or policies.\\\\c\\\\cBy the end of the first three years of his presidency, Chávez had successfully initiated a land transfer program and had introduced several reforms aimed at improving the social welfare of the population.  These reforms entailed the lowering of infant mortality rates; the implementation of a free, government-funded healthcare system; and free education up to the university level. By December of 2001, following Chávez\\\\s imposition of capital controls, inflation fell to 13.4% the lowest in 14 years, while economic growth was steady at four percent. Chávez\\\\s administration also reported an increase in primary school enrollment by one million students.\\\\c\\\\cOn April 9, 2002, CTV leader Carlos Ortega called for a two-day general strike. Approximately 500,000 people took to the streets on April 11, 2002 and marched towards the headquarters of Venezuela\\\\s state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), in defense of its recently-fired management. The organizers decided to redirect the march to Miraflores, the presidential palace, where a pro-Chávez demonstration was taking place.  Gunfire and violence erupted between two groups of demonstrators, Caracas\\\\ Metropolitan Police (under the control of the oppositionist mayor), and the Venezuelan national guard (under Chávez\\\\s command), and snipers were reported from the areas where both opposition and Chávez supporters were concentrated.  Domestic and international observers criticized the Government for excessive abuse of its right to call national broadcasts requiring all broadcast media to cease scheduled programming and transmit the broadcasts in their entirety.  Between April 9 and 11, the government required all radio and TV stations to transmit numerous speeches by President Chávez, other government officials, and other programming favorable to the Government, even shutting the signals of the stations who refused, in an attempt to block coverage of the demonstrations and ensuing violence.\\\\c\\\\cThen, unexpectedly, Lucas Rincón Romero, commander-in-chief of the Venezuelan armed forces, announced in a broadcast to a nationwide audience that Chávez had tendered his resignation from the presidency. While Chávez was brought to a military base and held there, military leaders appointed the president of the Fedecámaras, Pedro Carmona, as Venezuela\\\\s interim president. Carmona\\\\s first decree reversed all of the major social and economic policies that comprised Chávez\\\\s Bolivarian Revolution, including loosening Chávez\\\\s credit controls and ending his oil price quotas by raising production back to pre-Chávez levels. Carmona also dissolved both the National Assembly and the Venezuelan judiciary, while reverting the nation\\\\s name back to República de Venezuela.\\\\c\\\\cCarmona\\\\s decrees were followed by pro-Chávez uprisings and looting across Caracas. Responding to these disturbances, Venezuelan soldiers loyal to Chávez called for massive popular support for a counter-coup. These soldiers later stormed and retook the presidential palace, and retrieved Chávez from captivity. The shortest-lived government in Venezuelan history was thus toppled, and Chávez resumed his presidency on the night of Saturday, April 13, 2002. Following this episode, Rincón was reappointed by Chávez as Commander of the Army, and later as Interior Minister in 2003.  The opposition would later argue that, since Lucas Rincón remained close to the President, there was no coup but a power vacuum once Chávez resigned, despite the succession order being broken.\\\\c\\\\cControversy regarding US intervention raged afterwards. The Observer reports Otto Reich told Latin American diplomats the removal of Chavez was not a rupture of democratic rule, as he had resigned and was \\\\responsible for his fate\\\\ and that the US would support the Carmona government.After Chávez resumed his presidency in April 2002, he claimed that a plane with U.S. registration numbers had visited and been berthed at Venezuela\\\\s Orchila Island airbase, where Chávez had been held captive. On May 14, 2002, Chávez alleged that he had definitive proof of U.S. military involvement in April\\\\s coup. He claimed that during the coup Venezuelan radar images had indicated the presence of U.S. military naval vessels and aircraft in Venezuelan waters and airspace. The Guardian published a claim by former US intelligence officer Wayne Madsen alleging U.S. Navy involvement. Senator Christopher Dodd, D-CT, requested an investigation of concerns that Washington appeared to condone the removal of Mr Chávez, which subsequently found that U.S. officials acted appropriately and did nothing to encourage an April coup against Venezuela\\\\s president, nor did they provide any naval logistical support. According to Democracy Now!, CIA documents indicate that the Bush administration knew about a plot weeks before the April 2002 military coup.  They cite a document dated 6 April 2002, which says: dissident military factions...are stepping up efforts to organize a coup against President Chávez, possibly as early as this month.  According to William Brownfield, ambassador to Venezuela, the U.S. embassy in Venezuela warned Chávez about a coup plot in April 2002.  Further, the United States Department of State and the investigation by the Office of the Inspector General found no evidence that U.S. assistance programs in Venezuela, including those funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), were inconsistent with U.S. law or policy or . directly contributed, or was intended to contribute, to [the coup d\\\\état].\\\\c\\\\cChávez also claimed, during the coup\\\\s immediate aftermath, that the U.S. was still seeking his overthrow. On October 6, 2002, he stated that he had foiled a new coup plot, and on October 20, 2002, he stated that he had barely escaped an assassination attempt while returning from a trip to Europe.  During that period, the US Ambassador to Venezuela warned the Chávez administration of two potential assassination plots.\\\\c\\\\cFollowing his return to office, Chávez quickly took steps to secure support for his government. First, Chávez fired sixty generals and completely replaced the upper echelons of Venezuela\\\\s armed forces, substituting them with personnel that could be described as either more complacent, or more loyal to the state, depending on one\\\\s political affiliation. Chávez also sought to strengthen support among rank and file soldiers. He boosted support programs, employment, and benefits for veterans, while promulgating new civilian-military development initiatives.\\\\c\\\\cHowever, only a few months would pass after the April 2002 coup before the Chávez presidency would enter another crisis. Chávez, outraged by the coup and seeking more funds for his social programs, moved in late 2002 to implement total control over the PDVSA and its revenues. As a result, for two months following December 2, 2002, Chávez faced a strike organized by the resistant PDVSA management who sought to force Chávez out of office by completely removing his access to the all-important government oil revenue. The strike, led by a coalition of labor unions, industrial magnates, and oil workers, sought to halt the activities of the PDVSA. As a result, Venezuela ceased exporting its former daily average of 2,800,000 barrels (450,000 m3) of oil and oil derivatives. Hydrocarbon shortages soon erupted throughout Venezuela, with long lines forming at petrol-filling stations. Gasoline imports were soon required. Alarmed, Chávez responded by firing PDVSA\\\\s anti-Chávez upper-echelon management and dismissing 18,000 skilled PDVSA employees. Chávez justified this by alleging their complicity in gross mismanagement and corruption in their handling of oil revenues, while opposition supporters of the fired workers stated that his actions were politically-motivated.\\\\c\\\\cIn 2003 and 2004 Chávez launched a number of social and economic campaigns as he struggled to maintain popular support. In July 2003 he launched Mission Robinson, billed as a campaign aimed at providing free reading, writing and arithmetic lessons to the more than 1.5 million Venezuelan adults who were illiterate prior to his 1999 election. On October 12, 2003, Chávez initiated Mission Guaicaipuro, a program billed as protecting the livelihood, religion, land, culture, and rights of Venezuela\\\\s indigenous peoples. In late 2003, the Venezuelan president launched Mission Sucre, with the stated intent of providing free higher education to the two million adult Venezuelans who had not completed their elementary-level education. In November 2003, Chávez announced Mission Ribas, with the promise of providing remedial education and diplomas for Venezuela\\\\s five million high school dropouts. On the first anniversary of Mission Robinson\\\\s establishment, Chávez stated in Caracas\\\\s Teresa Carreño theater to an audience of 50,000 formerly illiterate Venezuelans, in a year, we have graduated 1,250,000 Venezuelans. Nevertheless, there were also significant setbacks. Notably, the inflation rate rocketed to 31% in 2002 and remained at the high level of 27% in 2003, causing a great deal of hardship for the poor.\\\\c\\\\cIn May 9, 2004, a group of 126 Colombians were captured during a raid of two farms near Caracas. The Colombians were outfit in Venezuelan military uniforms and testified that, once they arrived in Venezuela after receiving promises of legal employment, they were then hired for military action against Venezuelan regulars. The farm was owned by a Cuban anti-Fidel Castro exile and a leader in the unsuccessful 2002 coup.  Chávez soon levelled accusations of the attempted formation of a foreign-funded paramilitary force who intended to violently overthrow his rule. These events merely served to further the extreme and violent polarization of Venezuelan society between pro- and anti-Chávez camps. Chávez\\\\s allegations of a putative 2004 coup attempt continue to stir controversy and doubts to this day. In October 2005, 27 of the accused Colombians were found guilty, while the rest were released and deported.\\\\c\\\\cTemplate:ChavezElections2004\\\\c\\\\cIn early and mid-2003, Súmate, an opposition-aligned volunteer civilian voter rights organization, began the process of collecting the millions of signatures needed to activate the presidential recall provision provided for in Chávez\\\\s 1999 Constitution. In August 2003, around 3.2 million signatures were presented, but these were rejected by the pro-Chávez majority in the Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE; National Electoral Council) on the grounds that many had been collected before the mid-point of Chávez\\\\s presidential term. Reports then began to emerge among opposition and international news outlets that Chávez had begun to act punitively against those who had signed the petition, while pro-Chávez individuals stated that they had been coerced by employers into offering their signatures at their workplaces. In November 2003, the opposition collected an entirely new set of signatures, with 3.6 million names produced over a span of four days. Riots erupted nationwide as allegations of fraud were made by Chávez against the signature collectors.\\\\c\\\\cThe provision in the Constitution allowing for a presidential recall requires the signatures of 20% of the electorate in order to effect a recall.  Further, the cédulas (national identity card numbers) and identities of petition signers are not secret, and in fact were made public by Luis Tascón, a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly representing Chávez\\\\ party (Fifth Republic Movement - MVR) and the Communist Party of Venezuela of Táchira state.  The government was accused of increasing the voter rolls by giving citizenship to illegal immigrants and refugees, and the opposition claimed that it was a citizenship for votes program.  Voter registration increased by about 2 million people ahead of the referendum, which in effect raised the threshold of the 20% of the electorate needed to effect a recall.\\\\c\\\\cCredible anecdotal evidence emerged that Chávez and his allies were penalizing signers of the publicly posted petition by denying them government jobs and services. Charges were made of summary dismissals from government ministries, PDVSA, the state-owned water corporation, the Caracas Metro, and public hospitals controlled by Chávez\\\\s political allies. Finally, after opposition leaders submitted to the CNE a valid petition with 2,436,830 signatures that requested a presidential recall referendum, a recall referendum was announced on June 8, 2004 by the CNE. Chávez and his political allies responded to this by mobilizing supporters to encourage rejection of the recall with a no vote\\\\c\\\\cThe recall vote itself was held on August 15, 2004. A record number of voters turned out to defeat the recall attempt with a 59% no vote\\\\c\\\\cThe election was overseen by the Carter Center and the Organization of American States, and was certified by them as fair and open.\\\\c\\\\cEuropean Union observers did not attend, saying too many restrictions had been placed on their participation by the government. Critics called the results fraudulent, citing documents which indicated that the true results were the complete opposite of the reported ones, and raising questions about the government\\\\s ownership of voting machines.  Massive fraud was alleged and the conclusions of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter were questioned, although five other opposition polls showed a Chávez victory.\\\\c\\\\cA jubilant Chávez pledged to redouble his efforts against both poverty and imperialism, while promising to foster dialogue with his opponents. Chávez\\\\s government subsequently charged the founders of Súmate with treason and conspiracy for receiving foreign funds, earmarked for voter education, from the United States Department of State through the National Endowment for Democracy, triggering commentary from human rights organizations and the U.S.   The trial has been postponed several times.  A program called Mission Identity, to fast track voter registration of immigrants to Venezuela — including Chávez supporters benefiting from his subsidies — has been put in place prior to the upcoming 2006 presidential elections.\\\\c\\\\cIn the aftermath of his referendum victory, Chávez\\\\s primary objectives of fundamental social and economic transformation and redistribution accelerated dramatically. Chávez himself placed the development and implementation of the Bolivarian Missions once again at the forefront of his political agenda. Sharp increases in global oil prices gave Chávez access to billions of dollars in extra foreign exchange reserves. Economic growth picked up markedly, reaching double-digit growth in 2004 and a 9.3% growth rate for 2005.\\\\c\\\\cMany new policy initiatives were advanced by Chávez after 2004. In late March 2005, the Chávez government passed a series of media regulations that criminalized broadcasted libel and slander directed against public officials; prison sentences of up to 40 months for serious instances of character defamation launched against Chávez and other officials were enacted. When asked if he would ever actually move to use the 40-month sentence if a media figure insulted him, Chávez remarked that I don\\\\t care if they [the private media] call me names.... As Don Quixote said, \\\\If the dogs are barking, it is because we are working.\\\\ Chávez also worked to expand his land redistribution and social welfare programs by authorizing and funding a multitude of new Bolivarian Missions, including Mission Vuelta al Campo; the second and third phases of Mission Barrio Adentro, both first initiated in June 2005 with the stated aim of constructing, funding, and refurbishing secondary (integrated diagnostic center) and tertiary (hospital) public health care facilities nationwide; and Mission Miranda, which established a national citizen\\\\s militia. Meanwhile, Venezuela\\\\s doctors went on strike, protesting the siphoning of public funds from their existing institutions to these new Bolivarian ones, run by Cuban doctors.\\\\c\\\\cChávez focused considerably on Venezuela\\\\s foreign relations in 2004 and 2005 via new bilateral and multilateral agreements, including humanitarian aid and construction projects. Chávez has engaged, with varying degrees of success, numerous other foreign leaders, including Argentina\\\\s Néstor Kirchner, China\\\\s Hu Jintao, Cuba\\\\s Fidel Castro and Iran\\\\s Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. On March 4, 2005, Chávez publicly declared that the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was dead. Chávez stated that the neoliberal model of development had utterly failed in improving the lives of Latin Americans, and that an alternative, anti-capitalist model would be conceived in order to increase trade and relations between Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Chávez also stated his desire that a leftist, Latin American analogue of NATO be established.\\\\c\\\\cOver the course of 2004 and 2005, the Venezuelan military under Chávez also began in earnest to reduce weaponry sourcing and military ties with the United States. Chávez\\\\s Venezuela is thus increasingly purchasing arms from alternative sources, such as Brazil, Russia, China and Spain. Friction over these sales escalated, and in response Chávez ended cooperation between the militaries of the two countries. He also asked all active-duty U.S. soldiers to leave Venezuela. Additionally, in 2005 Chávez announced the creation of a large military reserve—the Mission Miranda program, which encompasses a militia of 1.5 million citizens—as a defensive measure against foreign intervention or outright invasion. Additionally, in October 2005, Chávez banished the Christian missionary organization New Tribes Mission from the country, accusing it of imperialist infiltration and harboring connections with the CIA. At the same time, he granted inalienable titles to over 6,800 square kilometers of land traditionally inhabited by Amazonian indigenous peoples to their respective resident natives, though this land could not be bought or sold as Western-style title deeds can. Chávez cited these changes as evidence that his revolution was also a revolution for the defense of indigenous rights, such as those promoted by Chávez\\\\s Mission Guaicaipuro.\\\\c\\\\cDuring this period, Chávez placed much greater emphasis on alternative economic development and international trade models, much of it in the form of extremely ambitious hemisphere-wide international aid agreements. For example, on August 20, 2005, during the first graduation of international scholarship students from Cuba\\\\s Latin American School of Medicine, Chávez announced that he would jointly establish with Cuba a second such medical school that would provide tuition-free medical training—an ex gratia project valued at between $20 and 30 billion—to more than 100,000 physicians who would pledge to work in the poorest communities of the Global South. He announced that the project would run for the next decade, and that the new school would include at least 30,000 new places for poor students from both Latin America and the Caribbean.\\\\c\\\\cChávez has also taken ample opportunity on the international stage to juxtapose such projects with the manifest results and workings of neoliberal globalization. Most notably, during his speech at the 2005 UN World Summit, he denounced development models that are organized around neoliberal guidelines such as liberalization of capital flows, removal of trade barriers, and privatization as the reason for the developing world\\\\s impoverishment. Chávez also went on to warn of an imminent global energy famine brought about by hydrocarbon depletion (based on Hubbert peak theory), stating that we are facing an unprecedented energy crisis.... Oil is starting to become exhausted. Additionally, on November 7, 2005, Chávez referenced the stalling of the FTAA, stating at the Fourth Summit of the Americas, held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, that the great loser today was George W. The man went away wounded. You could see defeat on his face. Chávez took the same opportunity to state that the taste of victory was apparent with regards to the promotion of his own trade alternative, the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA—Alternativa Bolivariana para América), which Venezuela and Cuba inaugurated on December 14, 2004.\\\\c\\\\cIn 2005, Chávez demanded the extradition of Luis Posada Carriles, accused of conspiring to bomb Cubana Flight 455. A Texas judge blocked the extradition on the grounds that he could be tortured in Venezuela; the Venezuelan embassy blamed the Department of Homeland Security for refusing to contest such accusations during the trial. Chávez also requested the extradition of former Venezuelan  officers and members of Militares democraticos, Lt. German Rodolfo Varela and Lt. Jose Antonio Colina, who are wanted for bombing the Spanish and Colombian embassies after Chávez made a speech criticizing both governments.\\\\c\\\\cThe BBC says that Chavez has made no secret of the fact that he is in favour of amending the constitution so that he can run again for president in 2012.  In spite of a presidential term limit of 12 years, according to The Economist, Chávez often suggests that he will remain in power for 25 years, a claim he denies as a misinterpretation of his intent.[citation needed]  Chávez has said that if the opposition boycotts the 2006 Venezuelan presidential election he might sign a decree calling for a popular referendum - Do you agree that Chavez should run for a third term in 2013?” He is campaigning for re-election in December.\\\\c\\\\cIn 2006 Chávez announced Venezuela\\\\s bid to win a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council; Washington officials are encouraging Latin American and Caribbean nations to vote instead for Guatemala. Analysts quoted by Forbes Magazine say that Chávez will offer to supply 20% of China\\\\s crude oil needs if Beijing backs Venezuela\\\\s bid to join the UN Security Council. In Chile, the press is concerned that Venezuelan grants for flood aid might affect the government\\\\s decision about which country to support for admission to the UN Security Council.\\\\c\\\\cIn accordance with his foreign policy trends, Chávez has visited several countries in Latin America, as well as Portugal, Belarus, Russia, Qatar, Syria, Iran, Vietnam, Mali and Benin.  At the request of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, Chávez also attended the 2006 summit of the African Union in Banjul.. He also visited the People\\\\s Republic of China and Malaysia.\\\\c\\\\cIn a highly controversial speech given to the United Nations General Assembly on 20 September, 2006, Chávez referred to United States President George W. Bush as the Devil (El Diablo). And the devil came here yesterday, said Chávez, referring to Bush\\\\s General Assembly speech of the previous day, Yesterday, the devil came here. Right here. Right here. And it smells of sulfur still today, this table that I am now standing in front of. At this point Chavez made the sign of the cross, positioned his hands as if praying and looked slowly up to the ceiling. He continued, Yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, from this rostrum, the president of the United States, the gentleman to whom I refer as the devil, came here, talking as if he owned the world. As the owner of the world. Chávez also cited a book (Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky) on imperialism and said it encapsulated his arguments: The American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its hegemonistic system of domination, and we cannot allow him to do that. We cannot allow world dictatorship to be consolidated\\\\c\\\\cIn response, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, an ardent critic of President Bush, called Chavez an everyday thug and not the modern day Simon Bolivar that he fancies himself to be.\\\\c\\\\cTemplate:Bolivarian Missions Infobox 1\\\\c\\\\cChávez\\\\s domestic policy relies heavily on the Bolivarian Missions, a series of political campaigns aimed at radically altering the economic and cultural landscape of Venezuela\\\\c\\\\cThe Bolivarian Missions have entailed the launching of massive government anti-poverty initiatives, the construction of thousands of free medical clinics for the poor, the institution of educational campaigns that have reportedly made more than one million adult Venezuelans literate, and the enactment of food and housing subsidies. There have been marked improvements in the infant mortality rate between 1998 and 2006.\\\\c\\\\cThe Missions have overseen widespread experimentation in what Chávez supporters term citizen- and worker-managed governance, as well as the granting of thousands of free land titles, reportedly to formerly landless poor and indigenous communities. Several allegedly unused estates and factories have been expropriated to provide this land.\\\\c\\\\cOn March 2006 the Communal Council Law was approved, whereby communities that decide to organize themselves into a council can be given official state recognition and access to federal funds and loans for community projects. This skips the local and state governments that are perceived as corrupt.\\\\c\\\\cChávez has had a combative relationship with the nation\\\\s largest trade union confederation, the Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV), which is historically aligned with the Acción Democrática (AD) party. During the December 2000 local elections, Chávez placed a referendum measure on the ballot that would mandate state-monitored elections within unions. The measure, which was condemned by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as undue interference in internal union matters, passed by a large margin on a very low electoral turnout. In the ensuing CTV elections, Carlos Ortega declared his victory and remained in office as CTV president, while chavista (pro-Chávez) candidates declared fraud.\\\\c\\\\cThe Unión Nacional de Trabajadores (UNT—National Union of Workers), a new pro-Chávez union federation, formed in response, and has been growing in membership; it seeks to ultimately supplant the CTV. Several chavista unions have withdrawn from the CTV because of their strident anti-Chávez activism, and have instead affiliated with the UNT. In 2003, Chávez chose to send UNT, rather than CTV, representatives to an annual ILO meeting.\\\\c\\\\cFurther augmenting state involvement in Venezuela\\\\s economy, Chávez nationalized Venepal, a formerly closed paper and cardboard manufacturing firm, on January 19, 2005. Workers had occupied the factory floor and restarted production, but following a failed deal with management and amidst management threats to liquidate the firm\\\\s equipment, Chávez ordered the nationalization, extended a line of credit to the workers, and ordered that the Venezuelan educational missions purchase more paper products from the company.\\\\c\\\\cVenezuela is a major producer of oil products, which remain the keystone of the Venezuelan economy. Chávez has gained a reputation as a price hawk in OPEC, pushing for stringent enforcement of production quotas and higher target oil prices.  At a June 2006 meeting, Venezuela was the only OPEC country calling for lowered production to drive oil prices higher. Industry analysts say Venezuela wants lower quotas because, under Chávez\\\\s administration, the output of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuela\\\\s state-owned oil company, has been reduced by 25% and Venezuela cannot meet its current quota. However, Forbes argues that some oil production numbers are politically motivated, intended to discredit the Venezuelan industry. Nonetheless, Chávez has attempted to broaden Venezuela\\\\s customer base, striking joint exploration deals with other developing countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China and India. Record oil prices have meant more funding for social programs, but have left the economy increasingly dependent on both the Chávez government and the oil sector; the private sector\\\\s role has correspondingly diminished.\\\\c\\\\cChávez has redirected the focus of PDVSA by bringing it more closely under the direction of the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum . He has also attempted to repatriate more oil funds to Venezuela by raising royalty percentages on joint extraction contracts that are payable to Venezuela. Chávez has also explored the liquidation of some or all of the assets belonging to PDVSA\\\\s U.S.-based subsidiary, Citgo. The Ministry of Energy and Petroleum has been successful in restructuring Citgo\\\\s profit structure, resulting in large increases in dividends and income taxes from PDVSA.\\\\c\\\\cDuring Chávez\\\\s presidency from 1999 to 2004, per-capita GDP dropped 1–2 %, but with the help of rising oil prices, the end of the oil strike, and strong consumption growth, recent economic activity under Chávez has been robust.  GDP growth rates were 18% in 2004, 9% in 2005, and 9.6% in the first half of 2006, with the private sector growing at a 10.3% clip. From 2004 to the first half of 2006, non-petroleum sectors of the economy showed growth rates greater than 10%. Datos reports real income grew by 137% between 2003 and Q1 2006. Official poverty figures dropped by 4.9%. Some economists argue that this subsidized growth could stop if oil prices decline, and some social scientists and economists claim that the government\\\\s reported poverty figures have not fallen in proportion to the country\\\\s vast oil revenues in the last two years\\\\c\\\\cThe president of Datos said that, although his surveys showed rising incomes because of subsidies and grants, the number of people in the worst living conditions has grown.  The poor of Venezuela are living much better lately and have increased their purchasing power . [but] without being able to improve their housing, education level, and social mobility, he said. Rather than help [the poor] become stakeholders in the economic system, what [the government has] done is distribute as much oil wealth as possible in missions and social programs.\\\\c\\\\cAccording to government figures, unemployment has dropped by 7% since the start of Chávez\\\\s presidency.   Venezuela\\\\s rate of unemployment dropped to 10% in February 2006 from the 2003 high of 20%, which occurred during a two-month strike and business lockout that shut down the country\\\\s oil industry. However, some economists argue that recent job creation may not be permanent, for it relies on an expanded public payroll that will become unaffordable if oil prices fall. According to the Venezuelan government, an unemployed person is a citizen above the age of 15 who has been seeking employment for more than one week. But, according to The Boston Globe, critics say that the government defines informal workers, such as street vendors, as employed, and exclud[es] adults who are studying in missions from unemployment numbers. Critics also point to figures released by the president of the Venezuelan National Statistics Institute, Elías Eljuri, which showed that poverty had actually risen by more than 10 percentage points under Chávez (to 53% in 2004). Chávez called for a new measure of poverty, a social well-being index.  Under this new definition, poverty registers at 40 percent. Eljuri denies changing the statistic and claims it is entirely income excluding social programs.  The World Bank calculated a 10% drop in poverty\\\\c\\\\cAccording to the Banco Central de Venezuela, inflation dropped from 29.9% to 14.4%. During 2005, imported goods were cheaper than commodities made in Venezuela; variability in the price of goods was linked to import performance and exchange stability. In the second quarter of 2006 gross fixed investment was the highest ever recorded by the Banco Central de Venezuela since it started tracking the statistic in 1997.\\\\c\\\\cWhile the Venezuelan Government enjoys a windfall of oil profits, the business environment is risky and discourages investment, according to El Universal.  As measured by prices on local stock exchanges, investors are willing to pay on average 16.3 years worth of earnings to invest in Colombia companies, 15.9 in Chile, 11.1 in Mexico, and 10.7 in Brazil, but only 5.8 in Venezuela. The World Economic Forum ranked Venezuela as 82 out of 102 countries on a measure of how favorable investment is for institutions.  In Venezuela, an investor needs an average of 119 days and must complete 14 different proceedings to organize a business, while the avarage in OECD countries is 30 days and six proceedings.\\\\c\\\\cPublic spending in Venezuela has broken unprecedented records as measured by local currency Central Bank debt, which could increase inflation.\\\\c\\\\cChávez has refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his so-called oil diplomacy. Chávez stated that Venezuela has a strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage . He said, It is a card that we are going to play with toughness against the toughest country in the world, the United States. Chávez has focused on a variety of multinational institutions to promote his vision of Latin American integration, including Petrocaribe, Petrosur, and TeleSUR. Bilateral trade relationships with other Latin American countries have also played a major role in his policy, with Chávez increasing arms purchases from Brazil, forming oil-for-expertise trade arrangements with Cuba, funding an ex gratia oil pipeline built to provide discounted natural gas to Colombia,[citation needed] and creating unique barter arrangements that exchange Venezuelan petroleum for cash-strapped Argentina\\\\s meat and dairy products. Additionally, Chávez worked closely with other Latin American leaders following the 1997 Summit of the Americas in many areas—especially energy integration—and championed the OAS decision to adopt the Anti-Corruption Convention. Chávez also participates in the United Nations Friends groups for Haiti, and is pursuing efforts to join and engage the Mercosur trade bloc to expand the hemisphere\\\\s trade integration prospects.\\\\c\\\\cAbroad, Chávez regularly portrays his movement\\\\s objectives as being diametrically opposed to neocolonialism and neoliberalism. Chávez has, for example, denounced U.S. foreign policy regarding areas such as Iraq, Haiti, and the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Chávez\\\\s warm and public friendship with Cuban President Fidel Castro has markedly compromised the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba diplomatically and economically. Long-standing ties between the U.S. and Venezuelan militaries were also severed by Chávez.  Moreover, his stance as an OPEC price hawk has made him unpopular in the United States. In 2000, Chávez made a ten-day tour of OPEC countries in a bid to promote his policies, becoming the first head of state to meet Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War\\\\c\\\\cChávez\\\\s foreign policy conduct and anti-Bush rhetoric has occasionally reached the level of personal attacks. Chávez once referred to U.S. Bush as a pendejo (dumbass), and constantly refers to him as Míster Danger. In a later speech, he made personal remarks regarding Condoleezza Rice, referring to her as a complete illiterate when it comes to comprehending Latin America.   On September 20, 2006 Chavez called Bush the devil\\\\c\\\\cAfter Hurricane Katrina battered the United States’ Gulf Coast in late 2005, the Chávez administration was the first foreign government to offer aid to the devastated regions. The Bush administration opted to refuse this aid. Later during the winter of 2005, various officials in the Northeastern United States signed an agreement with Venezuela to provide discounted heating oil to low income families.\\\\c\\\\cThere have also been heated disputes between Chávez and other Latin American leaders, including one with Mexican President Vicente Fox over what Chávez alleged was Fox\\\\s support of U.S. trade interests.  The dispute resulted in a strained diplomatic relationship between the two countries.  Another diplomatic row with Colombia, referred to as the Rodrigo Granda affair, occurred in 2004, after the kidnap of Rodrigo Granda, a high ranking member of the political wing of the FARC. In 2001, a dissension with Peru occurred over suspicions that Chávez\\\\s administration was protecting and hiding Vladimiro Montesinos, a former Peruvian intelligence director under the Alberto Fujimori administration, wanted for corruption.  Between January and March of 2006, Chávez commented on the candidates of the 2006 Peruvian Presidential election, openly backing Ollanta Humala while referring to Alan García as a thief and a crook.  The Peruvian government therefore admonished Chávez for interfering in Peru\\\\s affairs.\\\\c\\\\cOn August 3, 2006 Chávez ordered the Venezuelan chargé d\\\\affaires to Israel to return from Tel Aviv to Venezuela, protesting the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Israel responded by recalling its Israeli ambassador to Venezuela. Chávez made statements comparing Israel to Hitler and their actions to the Holocaust, and blaming the United States.\\\\c\\\\cHe was strongly criticized for trivializing the Holocaust.\\\\c\\\\cOn September 19, 2006, Chávez addressed the UN General Assembly, drawing some applause and tentative giggling by calling George Bush the devil. Chávez accused the U.S. government of domination, exploitation and pillage of peoples of the world. At the start of his talk, Chavez held up a book by American writer Noam Chomsky, Hegemony or Survival: America\\\\s Quest for Global Dominance, and recommended it to everyone in the General Assembly, as well as to the American people.\\\\c\\\\cThe people of the United States should read this ... instead of the watching Superman movies, Chavez later told reporters.\\\\c\\\\cChavez also said it was a shame that he did not get the chance to meet with Chomsky before he died (as of 9/23/2006 Noam Chomsky is still alive).\\\\c\\\\cEven before the April 2002 coup, many owners, managers, and commentators working for the five major private mainstream television networks and largest mainstream newspapers had stated their opposition to Chávez\\\\s policies. These media outlets have accused the Chávez administration of intimidating their journalists using specially-dispatched gangs.  Chávez in turn alleges that the owners of these networks have primary allegiance not to Venezuela but to the United States, and that they seek the advancement of what he terms neoliberalism via corporate propaganda\\\\c\\\\cThroughout his presidency, Chávez has hosted the live talk show known as Aló Presidente (Hello, President!). The show broadcasts in varying formats on Venezolana de Televisión (VTV—Venezuelan State Television) each Sunday at 11:00 AM. The show features Chávez addressing topics of the day, taking phone calls and live questions from both the studio and broadcast audience, and touring locations where government social welfare programs are active. Additionally, on July 25, 2005, Chávez inaugurated TeleSUR, a proposed pan-American homologue of Al Jazeera that seeks to challenge the present domination of Latin American television news by Univision and the United States-based CNN en Español. Chávez\\\\s media policies have contributed to elevated tensions between the United States and Venezuela.\\\\c\\\\cChávez\\\\s version of Bolivarianism, although drawing heavily from Simón Bolívar\\\\s ideals, was also influenced by the writings of Marxist historian Federico Brito Figueroa. Chávez was well acquainted with the various traditions of Latin American socialism espoused by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and Salvador Allende and from a young age by the Cuban revolutionary doctrine of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. Other key influences on Chávez\\\\s political philosophy include Ezequiel Zamora and Simón Rodríguez. Other indirect influences on Chávez\\\\s political philosophy are the writings of Noam Chomsky and the teachings of Jesus as recorded in the Bible (Chávez describes Jesus as the world\\\\s first socialist.)  Although Chávez himself refers to his ideology as Bolivarianismo (Bolivarianism), Chávez\\\\s supporters and opponents in Venezuela refer to themselves as being either for or against chavismo. Thus, Chávez supporters refer to themselves not as Bolivarians or Bolivarianists, but rather as chavistas.\\\\c\\\\cLater in his life, Chávez would acknowledge the role that democratic socialism (a form of socialism that emphasizes grassroots democratic participation) plays in Bolivarianism.  Because his Bolivarianism relies on popular support, Chávez has organized the Bolivarian Circles, which he cites as examples of grassroots and participatory democracy. The circles are charged with such tasks as neighborhood beautification, mass mobilization, lending support to small businesses, and providing basic social services, but critics are suspect of their independence and aims.\\\\c\\\\cWith respect to domestic policies, critics report that both corruption and crime are rampant. They also cite a failing infrastructure and public hospitals.   Criticism from Chávez supporters arises from reports that Chávez is not fulfilling his major campaign pledges with respect to labor and land reform.\\\\c\\\\cCritics have also charged that the Chávez government has engaged in gigantic fraud during the 2004 recall referendum.  Human rights organizations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented numerous human rights violations in Venezuela, although these have usually been reports of police misbehaviour and brutality rather than criticism of Chávez\\\\s policies.  The Venezuelan police have been criticised for human rights abuse for long before Chávez gained power. The United States government claims that his cooperation in the War on Terrorism is negligible or purposely indifferent with regards to the FARC and ELN; nonetheless, the U.S. government says there is no evidence of a direct link between terrorism and Chávez.\\\\c\\\\cSeveral public figures have even gone so far as to call for the assassination of Chávez, most notably US Conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson.  Other such requests have been expressed by Venezuelan actor Orlando Urdaneta and former president of Venezuela Carlos Andrés Pérez. The US Ambassador to Venezuela between 2001 and 2004, Charles Shapiro, also reported to the Chávez administration two potential assassination plots.\\\\c\\\\cChavez has been accussed of concentrating power of judicial and legislative branches.\\\\c\\\\cHugo Chávez has been married twice. He first wedded Nancy Colmenares, a woman from a poor family originating in Chávez\\\\s own hometown of Sabaneta. Chávez and Colmenares remained married for eighteen years, during which time they had three children: Rosa Virginia, María Gabriela, and Hugo Rafael. They separated soon after Chávez\\\\s 1992 coup attempt.  During his first marriage, Chávez also had an affair with young historian Herma Marksman; they had a relationship which lasted nine years, but ended. Chávez is separated from his second wife, journalist Marisabel Rodríguez de Chávez. Through that marriage, Chávez had another daughter, Rosa Inés. Chávez has one granddaughter, Gabriela.\\\\c\\\\cChávez is of Roman Catholic extraction.[citation needed] He has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic clergy and Protestant church hierarchies. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus\\\\ personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his leftist and progressivist views.He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro.\\\\c\\\\cUnited States Representative Charles Rangel (D) also said in a press release that an attack on Bush is attack on all of us (Americans).\\n',\n"," 'The Iraq War (2003 to the present), also known as the Second Gulf War is an ongoing war started by the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the successful overthrow of the then Iraq President Saddam Hussein, the subsequent occupation of Iraq by a United States-led coalition has resulted in ongoing asymmetric warfare between an insurgency and the occupying coalition forces and sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Iraqis.   The causes and consequences of the war remain controversial\\\\c\\\\cPrior to invasion, the United States and other coalition forces involved in the 1991 Persian Gulf War had been engaged in a low-level conflict with Iraq, by enforcing the two Iraqi no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country. Iraqi air-defense installations repeatedly targeted American and British air patrols and were often engaged by the coalition aircraft shortly afterwards. Approximately nine months after the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. initiated Operation Southern Focus as a change to its response strategy, by increasing the overall number of missions and selecting targets throughout the no-fly zones in order to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq.\\\\c\\\\cThe weight of bombs dropped increased from none in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 8 and 14 tons per month in May-August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6 tons in September - prior to Congress\\\\ 11 October authorization of the invasion. In retaliation for the Iraqi\\\\s now-daily air defense attacks on coalition aircraft, the September attacks included a 5 September 100-aircraft attack on the main air defence site in western Iraq. According to an editorial by Michael Smith for the New Statesman, this was Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias; it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected. military personnel stationed at Southern Watch headquarters during this time, recall that this attack, on this particular Iraqi air defense unit, was taken solely in reaction to Iraq\\\\s continued attack on coalition aircraft operating in compliance with the UN-mandated overflights of the Iraq no-fly zone.\\\\c\\\\cThe 2003 invasion of Iraq began on March 20, under the U.S. codename Operation Iraqi Freedom. military\\\\s codename for their participation in the invasion was called Operation Telic.  The coalition forces cooperated with Kurdish peshmerga forces in the north. Approximately forty other nations, in the U.S. dubbed coalition of the willing, also participated by providing equipment, services and security as well as special forces. This March 20, 2003, invasion marked the beginning of what is commonly referred to as the Iraq War.\\\\c\\\\cShortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) سلطة الائتلاف الموحدة as a transitional government of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government.  Citing UN Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), and the laws of war, the CPA vested itself with executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA\\\\s inception on April 21, 2003, until its dissolution on June 28, 2004.\\\\c\\\\cThe CPA was originally headed by Jay Garner, a former U.S. military officer, but his appointment lasted for only a brief time. After Garner resigned, President Bush appointed L. Paul Bremer as the head the CPA and he served until the CPA\\\\s dissolution in July 2004.\\\\c\\\\cAnother group created in the spring of 2003 was the Iraq Survey Group (ISG). This was a fact-finding mission sent by the multinational force in Iraq after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs developed by Iraq under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Its final report is commonly called the Duelfer Report. It consisted of a 1,400-member international team organized by The Pentagon and CIA to hunt for suspected stockpiles of WMD, such as chemical and biological agents, and any supporting research programs and infrastructure that could be used to develop WMD.\\\\c\\\\cOn May 1, 2003, President Bush staged a dramatic visit to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln while the ship was a few miles west of San Diego.  The Lincoln was on its way home to Everett, Washington from a long deployment which had included service in the Persian Gulf.  The visit climaxed at sunset with his now well-known Mission Accomplished speech.  This nationally-televised speech was delivered before the sailors and airmen on the flight deck.  Bush essentially declared victory at this time due to the defeat of Iraq\\\\s conventional forces (even though Saddam Hussein was at large and significant pockets of resistance remained).\\\\c\\\\cAfter Bush\\\\s speech in May of 2003, the coalition military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on their troops in various regions, especially the Sunni Triangle. In the initial chaos after the fall of the Iraqi government, there was massive looting of infrastructure, including government buildings, official residences, museums, banks, and military depots. According to The Pentagon, 250,000 tons (of 650,000 tons total) of ordnance was looted, providing a significant source of ammunition for the Iraqi insurgency. The hundreds of weapons caches already created by the conventional Iraqi army and Republican Guard further strengthened these looted supplies for the insurgents.\\\\c\\\\cAt first the resistance stemmed from fedayeen and loyalists of Saddam Hussein or the Ba\\\\ath Party,[citation needed] but soon religious radicals and Iraqis angered by the occupation contributed to the insurgency. The insurgents are generally known to the Coalition forces as Anti-Iraqi Forces\\\\c\\\\cThe initial insurgency in Iraq was concentrated in, but not limited to, an area referred to by Western media and the occupying forces as the Sunni triangle. This location includes Baghdad.  The three provinces that had the highest number of attacks were Baghdad, Anbar, and Salah Ad Din. -Those 3 provinces account for 35% of the population, but are responsible for 73% of U.S. military deaths (as of December 5, 2006), and an even higher percentage of recent U.S. military deaths (about 80%) .  This resistance has been described as a type of guerrilla warfare. Insurgent tactics include mortars, missiles, suicide bombers, snipers (cf. Juba, the Baghdad Sniper), improvised explosive devices (IEDs), roadside bombs, car bombs, small arms fire (usually with assault rifles), and RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), as well as sabotage against the oil, water, and electrical infrastructure.\\\\c\\\\cThe post-invasion environment began after the Hussein regime had been overthrown. It centers on Coalition and U.N. efforts to establish a stable democratic state capable of defending itself and holding itself together  and overcoming insurgent attacks and internal divisions.\\\\c\\\\cCoalition military forces launched several operations around Tigris River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. Toward the end of 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the Ramadan Offensive, as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Coalition forces brought to bear the use of air power for the first time since the end of the invasion. Suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions struck from the air and with artillery fire. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam’s birthplace of al-Auja and the small town of Abu Hishma were wrapped in barbed wire and carefully monitored\\\\c\\\\cHowever, the failure to restore basic services to above pre-war levels, where over a decade of sanctions, bombing, corruption, and decaying infrastructure had left major cities functioning at much-reduced levels, also contributed to local anger at the IPA government headed by an executive council. On July 2 2003, President Bush declared that American troops would remain in Iraq in spite of the attacks, challenging the insurgents with My answer is, bring \\\\em on, a line the President later expressed misgivings about having used.  In the summer of 2003, the multinational forces also focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the former regime. On July 22, 2003, during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and soldiers from Task Force 20, Saddam Hussein\\\\s sons (Uday and Qusay) and one of his grandsons were killed. In all, over 300 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel.\\\\c\\\\cIn the wave of intelligence information fueling the raids on remaining Ba\\\\ath Party members connected to insurgency, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on December 13 2003 on a farm near Tikrit in Operation Red Dawn. The operation was conducted by the U.S. Army\\\\s 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121\\\\c\\\\cWith the capture of Saddam and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks, some concluded the multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency. With the weather growing cooler, Coalition forces were able to operate in full armor which reduced their casualty rate.[citation needed] The provisional government began training the New Iraqi Security forces intended to defend the country, and the United States promised over $20 billion in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq\\\\s future oil revenues. Of this, less than half a billion dollars had been spent in 10 months after it had been promised.[citation needed]  Oil revenues were also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure.\\\\c\\\\cShortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an Iraqi Interim Government. Most prominent among these was the Shia cleric Ali al-Sistani. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time, preferring instead to eventually hand-over power to the Interim Iraqi Government. Due to the internal fight for power in the new Iraqi government more insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad(Sadr City) to Basra in the south.\\\\c\\\\cThe start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence. Insurgent forces reorganized during this time, studying the multinational forces\\\\ tactics and planning a renewed offensive. Guerrilla attacks were less intense. However, in late 2004 foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as al-Qaeda in Iraq (an affiliated al-Qaeda group), led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi would help to drive the insurgency.\\\\c\\\\cAs the insurgent activity increased, there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings.  One hypothesis for these increased bombings is that the relevance of Saddam Hussein and his followers was diminishing in direct proportion to the influence of radical Islamists, both foreign and Iraqi.  An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Mahdi Army also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive\\\\c\\\\cThe coalition and the Coalition Provisional Authority decided to face the growing insurgency with a pair of assaults: one on Fallujah, the center of the Mohammed\\\\s Army of Al-Ansar, and another on Najaf, home of an important mosque that had become the focal point for the Mahdi Army and its activities\\\\c\\\\cOn March 31, 2004 - Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy containing four American private military contractors from Blackwater USA who were conducting delivery for food caterers ESS\\\\c\\\\cThe four armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, were dragged from their cars, beaten, and set ablaze. Their burned corpses were then dragged through the streets before being hung over a bridge crossing the Euphrates.\\\\c\\\\cPhotos of the event were released to news agencies worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and moral outrage in the United States, and prompting the announcement of a upcoming pacification of the city.\\\\c\\\\cAfter this incident, the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force began plans to re-establish a coalition presence in Fallujah. On April 4, the multinational forces began assaults to clear Fallujah of insurgents. On April 9, the multinational force allowed more than 70,000 women, children and elderly residents to leave the besieged city, reportedly also allowing males of military age to leave. Meanwhile, insurgents were taking advantage of the lull in combat to prepare defenses for a second assault. On April 10, the military declared a unilateral truce to allow for humanitarian supplies to enter Fallujah. Troops pulled back to the outskirts of the city; local leaders reciprocated the ceasefire, although lower-level intense fighting on both sides continued.\\\\c\\\\cThe usage by the U.S. of white phosphorus in Fallujah attracted controversy. In the documentary Fallujah: The Hidden Massacre, aired on the Italian state television network RAI, a former soldier testified I saw the burned bodies of women and children. The phosphorus explodes and forms a plume. Who ever is within a 150 metre radius has no hope.     The U.S. State department first dismissed such claims,  but was later corrected in other reports. Lt Col Barry Venable stated to the BBC, it is an incendiary weapon and may be used against enemy combatants. According to Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, white phosphorus can be used, but only against enemy combatants and not civilians.  The Independent later reported that there remain widespread reports of civilians suffering extensive burn injuries. commanders insist they always strive to avoid civilian casualties, the story of the battle of Fallujah highlights the intrinsic difficulty of such an endeavour\\\\c\\\\cWhen the Iraqi Governing Council protested against the U.S. assault to retake Fallujah, the U.S. military halted its efforts. In the April battle for Fallujah, Coalition troops killed about 600 insurgents and a number of civilians, while 40 Americans died and hundreds were wounded in a fierce battle. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city, maintaining a perimeter around Fallujah. A compromise was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the local Fallujah Brigade. While the Marines attacking had a clear advantage in ground firepower and air support, LtGen Conway decided to accept a truce and a deal which put a former Ba\\\\athist general in complete charge of the town\\\\s security. The Fallujah Brigade\\\\s responsibility was to secure Fallujah and put a stop to insurgent mortar attacks on the nearby U.S. Marine bases. This compromise soon fell apart and insurgent attacks returned, causing Marine commanders to begin preparations for a second attack in the coming fall. By the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, Samarra, Baquba, and Ramadi had been left under guerrilla control with coalition patrols in the cities at a minimum.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cMeanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south, and Italian and Polish forces were having increasing difficulties retaining control over Nasiriya and Najaf. United States Marines were then shifted there to put down the overt rebellion and proceeded to rout Muqtada al-Sadr\\\\s Shiite militia. In all, April, May and early June saw more fighting. Over the next three months, the multinational forces took back the southern cities. Also, various insurgent leaders entered into negotiations with the provisional government to lay down arms and enter the political process\\\\c\\\\cOn June 28, 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority transferred the sovereignty of Iraq to a caretaker government, whose first act was to begin the trial of Saddam Hussein. However, fighting continued in the form of the Iraqi insurgency.  The new government began the process of moving towards open elections, though the insurgency and the lack of cohesion within the government itself, had led to delays. Militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr took control of Najaf and, after negotiations broke down, the government asked the United States for help dislodging him\\\\c\\\\cThrough the months of July and August, a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imam Ali Mosque itself under siege, only to have a peace deal brokered by Grand Ayatollah Sistani in late August.\\\\c\\\\cThe First Battle of Fallujah in April 2004 created an area of extreme instability and a de facto insurgent safe zone.  After several months of this situation, in November 2004 coalition forces attacked and successfully captured Fallujah in the Second Battle of Fallujah.  This battle resulted in the reputed death of over 5,000 insurgent fighters. Marines (the main coalition force in combat) also took substantial casualties with 95 dead and around 500 wounded in action.  According to local sources, hundreds of civilians were also killed and much of the city was destroyed in the battle.\\\\c\\\\cOn January 31, an election for a government to draft a permanent constitution took place. Although some violence and lack of widespread Sunni Arab participation marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On February 4, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 U.S. troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month. February, March and April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70.\\\\c\\\\cHopes for a quick end to an insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops were dashed at the advent of May, Iraq\\\\s bloodiest month since the invasion by U.S. forces in March and April of 2003.  Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S\\\\c\\\\cDuring early and mid-May, the U.S. also launched Operation Matador, an assault by around 1,000 Marines in the ungoverned region of western Iraq.  Its goal was the closing of suspected insurgent supply routes of volunteers and material from Syria, and with the fight they received their assumption proved correct.  Fighters armed with flak jackets (unseen in the insurgency before this time) and using sophisticated tactics met the Marines, eventually inflicting 31 U.S. casualties by the operation\\\\s end, and suffering 125 casualties themselves.  The Marines were unable to recapture the region due to their limited numbers and the continual insurgent IED attacks and ambushes. The operation continued all the way to the Syrian border, where they were forced to stop (Syrian residents living near the border heard the American bombs very clearly during the operation).  The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the U.S. could bring the full force of its firepower on them, as it did in Fallujah.\\\\c\\\\cOn August 14, 2005 the Washington Post  quoted one anonymous U.S. senior official expressing that the United States no longer expects to see a model new democracy, a self-supporting oil industry or a society in which the majority of people are free from serious security or economic challenges... \\\\What we expected to achieve was never realistic given the timetable or what unfolded on the ground\\\\. On September 22, 2005, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said that he had warned the Bush administration in recent days that Iraq was hurtling toward disintegration, and that the election planned for December was unlikely to make any difference.  U. officials immediately made statements rejecting this belief .\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the ratification of the Constitution of Iraq on October 15 2005, a general election was held on 15 December to elect a permanent 275-member Iraqi National Assembly.\\\\c\\\\cThe beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. The United Nations has recently described the environment in Iraq as a civil war-like situation. A 2006 study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has estimated that more than 601,000 Iraqis have died in  violence since the U.S. invasion and that fewer than one third of these deaths came at the hands of Coalition forces. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Iraqi government estimate that more than 365,000 Iraqis have been displaced since the bombing of the al-Askari Mosque, bringing the total number of Iraqi refugees to more than 1.6 million.\\\\c\\\\cOn February 22 2006, at 6:55 a.m. local time (0355 UTC) two bombs were set off by five to seven men dressed as personnel of the Iraqi Special forces who entered the Al Askari Mosque during the morning. Explosions occurred at the mosque, effectively destroying its golden dome and severely damaging the mosque. Several men, one wearing a military uniform, had earlier entered the mosque, tied up the guards there and set explosives, resulting in the blast.\\\\c\\\\cShiites across Iraq expressed their anger by destroying Sunni mosques and killing dozens. Religious leaders of both sides called for calm amid fears this could erupt into a long-feared Sunni-Shia civil war in Iraq.\\\\c\\\\cOn March 2 the director of the Baghdad morgue fled Iraq explaining,\\\\c\\\\c7,000 people have been killed by death squads in recent months.  The Boston Globe reported that around eight times the number of Iraqis killed by terrorist bombings during March 2006 were killed by sectarian death squads during the same period. A total of 1,313 were killed by sectarian militias while 173 were killed by suicide bombings. The LA Times later reported that about 3,800 Iraqis were killed by sectarian violence in Baghdad alone during the first three months of 2006. During April 2006, morgue numbers showed that 1,091 Baghdad residents were killed by sectarian executions.\\\\c\\\\cInsurgencies, frequent terrorist attacks and sectarian violence led to harsh criticism of U.S. Iraq policy and fears of a failing state and civil war. The concerns were expressed by several U.S. think tanks \\\\c\\\\c\\\\c\\\\c as well as the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad\\\\c\\\\cIn early 2006, a handful of high-ranking retired generals began to demand United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld\\\\s resignation due in part to the aforementioned chaos that resulted from his management of the war.\\\\c\\\\cThe current government of Iraq took office on May 20, 2006 following approval by the  members of the Iraqi National Assembly. This followed the general election in December 2005. The government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government which had continued in office in a caretaker capacity until the new government was agreed.\\\\c\\\\cIn September 2006, The Washington Post reported that the commander of the Marine forces in Iraq filed an unusual secret report concluding that the prospects for securing the Anbar province are dim, and that there is almost nothing the U.S. military can do to improve the political and social situation there\\\\c\\\\cIraq was listed fourth on the 2006 Failed States Index compiled by the American Foreign Policy magazine and the Fund for Peace think-tank.  The list was topped by Sudan\\\\c\\\\cAs of October 20 the U.S military announced that operation Together Forward had failed to stem the tide of violence in Baghdad, and Shiite Militants Under al-Sadr seized several southern Iraq Cities.\\\\c\\\\cOn November 8, 2006, Donald Rumsfeld tendered his resignation as United States Secretary of Defense.  President George W. Bush then appointed former CIA chief Robert Gates to replace him.\\\\c\\\\cOn November 23, 2006 the deadliest attack since the beginning of the Iraq war occurred.  According to The Associated Press, suspected Sunni-Arab militants used five suicide car bombs and two mortar rounds on the capital\\\\s Shiite Sadr City slum to kill at least 215 people and wound 257 on Thursday. Shiite mortar teams quickly retaliated, firing 10 shells at Sunni Islam\\\\s most important shrine in Baghdad, badly damaging the Abu Hanifa mosque and killing one person. Eight more rounds slammed down near the offices of the Association of Muslim Scholars, the top Sunni Muslim organization in Iraq, setting nearby houses on fire. Two other mortar barrages on Sunni neighborhoods in west Baghdad killed nine and wounded 21, police said late Thursday.\\\\c\\\\cA bipartisan report by the Iraq Study Group was released on December 6th, 2006. The group was led by former secretary of state James Baker and former Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton, and concludes that the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating and U.S. forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end. The report\\\\s 79 recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with Iran and Syria and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops. On December 18th, a Pentagon report finds that attacks on Americans and Iraqis average about 960 a week, the highest since the reports began in 2005\\\\c\\\\cCoalition forces formally transferred control of a province to the Iraqi government. The shift is the first of its kind since the war began. Military prosecutors charged 8 Marines with the deaths of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha that allegedly occured in November 2005. Ten of the casualties were reported to be women and children. Four officers were also charged with dereliction of duty in relation to the event. Saddam Hussein, captured in December 2003, was hanged on December 30th, 2006 after being found guilty of crimes against humanity.  President Bush works to find a new way forward for the new year, following the prior month\\\\s resignation of Donald Rumsfeld. Some speculate that a shift in American policy in Iraq is forthcoming.\\\\c\\\\c(Note: This section is used to track various developing events incrementally, by citing materials around the web.

These guerrilla units were the precursor to the eventual formation of what came to be known as the Iraqi insurgency, or those Iraqis and foreigners who attacked coalition or government forces.\\\\c\\\\cMore recently in late 2005 and 2006, due to increasing sectarian violence based on either tribal/ethnic distinctions or simply due to increased criminal violence, there has been the formation of various militias. Many of these militias have been formed in response to violent acts committed on the basis of the Shia/Sunni distinction, with whole neighborhoods and cities sometimes being protected or attacked by ethnic or neighborhood militias.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cThe insurgents and guerrilla units favored attacking unarmored vehicles and avoiding major battles. The early Iraqi insurgency was concentrated in, but not limited to, an area referred to by the Western media and the occupying forces as the Sunni triangle which includes Baghdad. The insurgents dead are numbered between 45-60,000\\\\c\\\\cBy the fall of 2003, these insurgent groups began using typical guerrilla tactics such as ambushes, bombings, kidnappings, and improvised explosive devices.  Other tactics included mortars, suicide bombers, roadside bombs, small arms fire, and RPGs, as well as sabotage against the oil, water, and electrical infrastructure. Multi-national Force-Iraq statistics (see detailed BBC graphic) show that the insurgents primarily targeted coalition forces, Iraqi security forces and infrastructure, and lastly civilians and government officials.  The civilian death log reveals that a large majority of the deaths were by car bombs, booby traps, throat slitting, beheading and other techniques that are known to be associated with insurgents.[citation needed]  These irregular forces favored attacking unarmored or lightly armored Humvee vehicles, the U.S. military\\\\s primary transport vehicle.  In November 2003, some of these forces successfully attacked U.S. rotary aircraft with SAM-7 missiles bought on the global black market.[citation needed] Insurgent groups such as the al-Abud Network have even attempted to constitute their own chemical weapons programs, attempting to weaponize traditional mortar rounds with ricin and mustard toxin\\\\c\\\\cThere is evidence that some guerrilla groups are organized, perhaps by the fedayeen and other Saddam Hussein or Ba\\\\ath loyalists, religious radicals, Iraqis angered by the occupation, and foreign fighters.  On February 23, 2005 Al-Iraqiya TV (Iraq) aired transcripts of confessions by Syrian intelligence officer Anas Ahmad Al-Issa and Iraqi insurgent Shihab Al-Sab\\\\awi concerning their booby-trap operations, explosions, kidnappings, assassinations, and details of beheading training in Syria.  The insurgents are known by the Coalition military (especially in the United States armed forces) as Anti-Iraqi Forces (AIF)\\\\c\\\\cOne insurgent, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed on June 7 2006 in the town of Baquba, north of Baghdad, when U.S. warplanes dropped two 500-pound bombs on his isolated safe house.  Zarqawi, a Jordanian, did not fit the usual profile of an Iraqi insurgent and had closer ties to the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Still, President George W. Bush said the killing was a severe blow to al-Qaida and it is a significant victory in the war on terror but cautioned: We have tough days ahead of us in Iraq that will require the continuing patience of the American people.\\\\c\\\\cDespite Zarqawi\\\\s death Al-Qaeda in Iraq vowed to continue its holy war, according to a statement posted on a Web site announcing: We want to give you the joyous news of the martyrdom of the mujahed sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Zarqawi\\\\s death may have had little impact on the violence since evidence of continued violence in Iraq could still be seen in the month of June with over 1,600 Iraqi deaths that month, the highest monthly total to date since the Al Askari Mosque bombing\\\\c\\\\cIn addition to internal strife, Iran may be playing a role in the insurgency. Michael Barbero said, Iran is definitely a destabilizing force in Iraq, Barbero said. I think it\\\\s irrefutable that Iran is responsible for training, funding and equipping some of these Shia extremist groups.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cThe insurgent tactic that is responsible for the most U.S. deaths and injuries is the\\\\c\\\\croadside IED. military has taken measures to counter the IEDs, including\\\\c\\\\carmoring humvees (mostly on the bottom, where roadside bombs usually hit)\\\\c\\\\cand using radio frequency jammers (so as to prevent bomb detonation). The insurgents\\\\c\\\\chave adapted to those tactics by using larger explosives, shaped charges,\\\\c\\\\calternative detonation methods (including electrical wires, mechanical strings, trip wires, and infrared beams),\\\\c\\\\cand placing bombs on telephone poles and the underside of bridges (so as to attack the top and\\\\c\\\\csides of vehicles rather than the highly-armored bottom).\\\\c\\\\cTwo of the most powerful current militias are the Mahdi Army and the Badr Organization, with both militias having substantial political support as well in the current Iraqi government. Initially, both organizations were involved in the Iraqi insurgency, most clearly seen with the Mahdi Army at the Battle of Najaf. However in recent months, there has been a split between the two groups.\\\\c\\\\cThis violent break between Muqtada al-Sadr\\\\s Mahdi Army and the rival Badr Organization of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, was seen in the fighting in the town of Amarah on October 20, 2006, would severely complicate the efforts of Iraqi and American officials to quell the soaring violence in Iraq\\\\c\\\\cThe war in Iraq was originally justified as part of the U.S.-led War on Terrorism.  Specifically, the Bush Administration argued that Saddam Hussein had ties to al-Qaeda, and that his overthrow would lead to democratization in the Middle East, decreasing terrorism overall.  The alleged ties between Saddam and al-Qaeda were never confirmed, however, and numerous reports of intelligence agencies investigating the matter -- including several reports of the CIA, the U.S. State Department, the FBI, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as the investigations of foreign intelligence agencies -- concluded that no evidence had been found supporting an operational connection between Saddam and al-Qaeda.  The New York Times commented in September 2006 on the conclusions of the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, there is no evidence that Saddam Hussein had prewar ties to Al Qaeda and one of the terror organization’s most notorious members, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi.\\\\c\\\\cHowever, al-Qaeda leaders have seen the Iraq war as a boon to their recruiting and operational efforts, providing both evidence to jihadists worldwide that America is at war with Islam, and the training ground for a new generation of jihadists to practice attacks on American forces.  In October 2003, Osama bin Laden announced: Be glad of the good news: America is mired in the swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates. Bush is, through Iraq and its oil, easy prey. Here is he now, thank God, in an embarrassing situation and here is America today being ruined before the eyes of the whole world.  Al-Qaeda commander Seif al-Adl gloated about the war in Iraq, indicating, The Americans took the bait and fell into our trap.  A letter thought to be from al-Qaeda leader Atiyah Abd al-Rahman found in Iraq among the rubble where al-Zarqawi was killed and released by the U.S. military in October 2006, indicated that al-Qaeda perceived the war as beneficial to its goals: The most important thing is that the jihad continues with steadfastness ... indeed, prolonging the war is in our interest.\\\\c\\\\cIn the years since the war began, a consensus has developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq war has increased terrorism. Counterterrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna frequently referred to the invasion of Iraq as a fatal mistake that had greatly increased terrorism in the Middle East.  London\\\\s conservative International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become a potent global recruitment pretext for jihadists and that the invasion galvanized al-Qaeda and perversely inspired insurgent violence there. National Intelligence Council concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; David B. Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills...  There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries.  The Council\\\\s Chairman Robert L. Hutchings said, At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity.  And the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate, which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, held that The Iraq conflict has become the \\\\cause celebre\\\\ for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement.\\\\c\\\\cSee Also Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda timeline, Atta in Prague\\\\c\\\\cSee the above main articles for much more info, and for casualty numbers for coalition nations, contractors, non-Iraqi civilians, journalists, media helpers, aid workers, wounded, etc.. Casualty figures, especially Iraqi ones, are highly disputed.  This section gives a brief overview. There are now at least 8 independent estimates of the number or rate of deaths induced by the invasion of Iraq\\\\c\\\\cThe icasualties.org  website reports the death toll since the invasion in March 2003 as being 3,005 American lives (as of January 2, 2007). There have been a further 250 deaths among the troops of other coalition nations: Australia 2. Bulgaria 13. Denmark 6. El Salvador 5. Estonia 2. Hungary 1. Italy 33. Kazakhstan 1. Latvia 3. Netherlands 2. Poland 18. Romania 2. Slovakia 4. Spain 11. Thailand 2. Ukraine 18. United Kingdom 127\\\\c\\\\cEstimates of Iraqi deaths are highly disputed. In December 2005 President Bush said there were 30,000 Iraqi dead as a guess. CNN wrote: White House spokesman Scott McClellan later said Bush was basing his statement on media reports, \\\\not an official government estimate.\\\\   U.S. General Tommy Franks reportedly estimated soon after the invasion that there had been 30,000 Iraqi casualties as of April 9, 2003. After that he made no estimate of death tolls in Iraq. In March 2002 in Afghanistan at a news conference at Bagram Air Base, General Tommy Franks had famously said, we don\\\\t do body counts\\\\c\\\\cFor 2006, a January 2, 2007 Associated Press article reports: The tabulation by the Iraqi ministries of Health, Defence and Interior, showed that 14,298 civilians, 1,348 police and 627 soldiers had been killed in the violence that raged across the country last year. The Associated Press figure, gleaned from daily news reports from Baghdad, arrived at a total of 13,738 deaths.  The Australian reports in a January 2, 2007 article: A figure of 3700 civilian deaths in October [2006], the latest tally given by the UN based on data from the Health Ministry and the Baghdad morgue, was branded exaggerated by the Iraqi Government.  Iraqi government estimates include people killed in bombings and shootings but not deaths classed as \\\\criminal\\\\. Also, they include no deaths among the many civilians wounded in attacks who may die later from wounds. Nor do they include many people kidnapped whose fate remains unknown\\\\c\\\\cIn comparison, the Iraq Body Count project states for the week ending Dec. 31, 2006 : It was a truly violent year, as around 24,000 civilians lost their lives in Iraq. This was a massive rise in violence: 14,000 had been killed in 2005, 10,500 in 2004 and just under 12,000 in 2003 (7,000 of them killed during the actual war, while only 5,000 killed during the ‘peace’ that followed in May 2003). In December 2006 alone around 2,800 civilians were reported killed. This week there were over 560 civilian deaths reported.\\\\c\\\\cIn its Quick-FAQ  the IBC states: It is likely that many if not most civilian casualties will go unreported by the media. That is the sad nature of war. The IBC counts only those deaths reported by English-language media, and since the invasion began has counted around 50,000 civilian deaths attributable to insurgent or military action in Iraq, and also to increased criminal violence above the level before the invasion. For many examples of undercounting of deaths in Iraq by the media, hospitals, morgues, government agencies, coalition military, etc. see the Undercounting section of Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003.\\\\c\\\\cAn independent method for estimating the number of Iraq dead is by using national surveys of mortality. A study in The Lancet estimates 654,965 Iraqi deaths (with a range of 392,979 to 942,636) from March 2003 to July 2006, using this methodology  . That total number of deaths (civilian and non-civilian) includes all excess deaths due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poor healthcare, etc, and includes civilians, military deaths and insurgent deaths. This result was disputed by Bush based both on the number of deaths and the methodology \\\\c\\\\cThe various casualty estimates are not necessarily conflicting. The Lancet study states: Aside from Bosnia, we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance [used by the IBC] recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods [used in the Lancet studies]. In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates. Between 1960 and 1990, newspaper accounts of political deaths in Guatemala correctly reported over 50% of deaths in years of low violence but less than 5% in years of highest violence\\\\c\\\\cIn December 2006, the report of the Iraq Study Group (ISG) found that the United States has filtered out reports of violence in order to disguise its policy failings in Iraq . The ISG found that U.S. officials reported 93 attacks or significant acts of violence on one day in July 2006, yet a careful review of the reports for that single day brought to light more than 1,100 acts of violence.\\\\c\\\\cA November 11, 2006 Los Angeles Times article reports: \\\\c\\\\cAs of November 4, 2006, the U.N.

The Congressional Research Service recently estimated weekly spending at almost $2 billion per week, and that total expenditures have now topped half a trillion dollars. Additionally, the extended combat and equipment loss have placed a severe financial strain on the U.S Army, causing the elimination of non-essential expenses such as travel and civilian hiring\\\\c\\\\cData from the Office of Management and Budget shows that the discretionary defense spending is 20% of government outlays, and the CIA World Factbook lists a 2005 estimate of U.S. military expenditure as 4.06% of GDP (the 26th position in a listing of 167 countries). Other figures, however, show that the total defense expenditures (Department of Defense, Homeland Security and War on Terror) amount to $563 billion, which represents 56% of the nation\\\\s discretionary budget  and 47% of the world military spending.\\\\c\\\\cAs of March 2006, approximately £4.5 billion had been spent by the United Kingdom in Iraq. All of this money has come from a government fund called the Special Reserve which has a current allocation of £6.44 billion\\\\c\\\\cIt is not known how much more money has been spent by other members of the coalition; however, the US\\\\s share of the cost is by far the largest.\\\\c\\\\cIn addition to the human casualties suffered in the war, the U.S. has also lost a number of pieces of military equipment.  This total is approximate and includes those vehicles lost in non-combat-related accidents. Recently, the Army has said that the cost of replacing its depleted equipment has tripled from that of 2005\\\\c\\\\cAs of December 2006, according to government data reported by the Washington Post, On December 5 2006, the military stated that nearly 40% of the army’s total equipment has been lost in Iraq, with an estimated yearly replacement cost of $US 17 billion. Furthermore the military states that the replacement cost has increased by a factor of ten compared to that of the pre-war state.\\\\c\\\\cCombat losses: Land equipment\\\\c\\\\c20     M1 Abrams tanks\\\\c\\\\c55     Bradley fighting vehicles\\\\c\\\\c20     Stryker wheeled combat vehicles\\\\c\\\\c20     M113 armored personnel carriers\\\\c\\\\c250    Humvees\\\\c\\\\c500+   Mine clearing vehicles, heavy/medium trucks, and trailers\\\\c\\\\c10     Amphibious Assault Vehicles  \\\\c\\\\cCombat losses: Air equipment\\\\c\\\\c27     Apache attack helicopters\\\\c\\\\c21     Blackhawk utility helicopters\\\\c\\\\c14     Chinook cargo helicopters\\\\c\\\\c23     Kiowa surveillance helicopters\\\\c\\\\c4      CH-46E Sea Knight cargo helicopters \\\\c\\\\c1      A-10 Thunderbolt II ground attack aircraft\\\\c\\\\c1      F-15E Strike Eagle fighter aircraft \\\\c\\\\c2      UH-1N Huey utility helicopters\\\\c\\\\c8      AH-1 Cobra attack helicopters\\\\c\\\\c5      CH-53E Super Stallion or MH-53 Pave Low helicopters\\\\c\\\\c2      H-3 Sea King helicopters\\\\c\\\\c25+    RQ-1 Predator unmanned aerial vehicles\\\\c\\\\c3      F/A-18 Hornet fighter aircraft\\\\c\\\\c2      C-130 Hercules aircraft\\\\c\\\\c1      F-16 Fighting FalconCG (90-0776)\\\\c\\\\cA growing number of citizens in coalition nations have urged their governments to withdraw from Iraq. Supporters of withdrawal argue that the Iraq war is unwinnable, has no purpose, has parallels with the Vietnam war,   has a huge financial cost, as well as the loss of innocent human life, and will be ended by a withdrawal of troops.\\\\c\\\\cAnother consideration is the destabilization to the Middle East region that may occur as a consequence of the sudden departure of the United States military.[citation needed] Given the strained relations between the United States and Iraq\\\\s neighbor, Iran, and considering the powerful influence of Iran among Iraq\\\\s Shi\\\\a Muslim community, some people[who?] fear that Iraq is going to convert into a fundamentalist-lead client state of Iran. The civil strife between the Sunni and Shi\\\\a communities, as well as Kurdish hopes of establishing an independent state of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, could lead to a full-scale civil war.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cmilitary strategy in Iraq has drawn criticism from a number of different circles.  Military historian Martin van Creveld, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has called the Iraq war the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 BC sent his legions into Germany and lost them.\\\\c\\\\cThere is also a large amount of criticism from people that support the war but criticize the current military strategy, believing that the current strategy causes unnecessary deaths and injuries of coalition and Iraqi troops, as well as civilian contractors, and does not adequately meet the insurgent threat.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cIncluded within this is the criticism that, if the military strategy were much more effective,\\\\c\\\\cthen there would be much more support for the war among the people of the coalition countries,\\\\c\\\\cespecially the United States.[citation needed] In a classified memo to the current administration, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently revealed that he believed the current stategy in Iraq was not working and was in need of change.\\\\c\\\\cMany specific strategic criticisms have been made by various individuals and publications.\\\\c\\\\cSome major criticisms include:\\\\c\\\\cPrisoners in Iraq detained by U.S. troops are treated badly, and it is estimated that about 1/4th of them are innocent, and many prisoners are subsequently released. The bad treatment of those prisoners angers the civilian population and turns them against the United States. These critics say that prisoners should be treated humanely. (this criticism was made on Nightline , among other places)\\\\c\\\\cThere is a very large number of explosion-induced injuries to soldiers\\\\ arms, legs, and faces, including many losses of limbs. Such injuries could be greatly reduced if the soldiers wore light-weight, ventilated, heat-resistant polymer (such as aramid) over their arms and legs, and transparent polycarbonate face masks, which not strong enough to stop a bullet, can prevent much of the damage from the hot particles of explosives.[citation needed] This also applies to the Iraqi police, who are severely under-equipped , and who suffer far more deaths and injuries than coalition troops , and are the permanent stabilizing force that, if strong enough, may allow the coalition troops to withdraw\\\\c\\\\cMost injuries and deaths to coalition troops and Iraqi police are due to covertly-placed roadside bombs (often called  IEDs (improvised explosive devices)) and car bombs. The casualties of coalition troops and Iraqi police depend on the fact that such troops are clearly marked by their uniforms. That not only provides the insurgents with targets, but it also shows them who to avoid when conducting covert activities such as bomb placement. If the coalition troops and Iraqi police used more covert tactics, including the use of plain-clothes Iraqi police posing as militia men (it would not work for coalition members, due to the conspicuousness of both their race and their language), the use of hidden cameras with nightvision capability, and constant aerial surveillance of roads (such as by predator drones), then coalition and Iraqi forces would be able to prevent insurgents planting bombs. It is only by watching such insurgents when they think that they are not being watched, that they can be seen and killed. Covert surveillance and plainclothes Iraqi troops in a perimeter around overt coalition and Iraqi troop positions would also be effective in sniper attacks and gun battles.\\\\c\\\\cTemplate:TotallyDisputed-section\\\\c\\\\cConcerns have been raised of insufficiently critical coverage of the activities of U.S. forces in Iraq. In December 2006, the report of the Iraq Study Group (ISG) found that the United States has filtered out reports of violence in order to disguise its policy failings in Iraq . The ISG found that U.S. officials reported 93 attacks or significant acts of violence on one day in July 2006, yet a careful review of the reports for that single day brought to light more than 1,100 acts of violence.\\\\c\\\\cIt has been reported in European media, including countries involved in operations in Iraq, that a minority[citation needed] of American soldiers and marines in Iraq have behaved irresponsibly in Iraq, causing unnecessary deaths of civilians. At the same time, many believe that U.S. forces have come under little U.S. media scrutiny.[citation needed] Even in the most extreme cases, such as the Haditha massacre, U.S. media coverage has been considerably less than in European countries such as the United Kingdom.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cThe killing of Nicola Calipari by an American soldier, which Italian prosecutors are now classifying as murder, received U.S. media coverage because the victim was an Italian Major-General. This incident fits a pattern, suggested by most of the mainstream European media (especially in the British Guardian newspaper and the French Le Monde newspaper), of widespread unprovoked fatal incidents.[citation needed] Another cited example is the killing of British reporter Terry Lloyd, who was found by the coroner to have been unlawfully killed by U.S. marines in Iraq . The Independent on Sunday (15 October 2006) suggested that this death was the result of U.S. soldiers\\\\ hostility to his decision to report independently rather than being embedded with coalition forces.\\\\c\\\\cOfficials in the Bush Administration have claimed that the media overemphasizes negative stories and does not report the positive developments in Iraq with the same vigor.[verification needed]  Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal published more than double as many negative headlines as positive on the Iraq War between May 2003 and May 2006, while NBC News and ABC News televised an even higher proportion of negative headlines in the same period.  Fox News, however, had a higher proportion of neutral headlines than its competitors.\\\\c\\\\cCritics have long questioned the reliance of the major media outlets on Iraqi stringers with suspected ties to insurgent groups and terrorists as a source of information -- discounting the versions of events as explained by the coalition and the Iraqi government.[who?]  For example, on November 24, 2006, the AP distributed a story from one of their stringers, sourced by an Iraqi Police officer named Jamil Hussein, of four mosques being burned to the ground along with the deaths of six Sunni worshipers who were doused in kerosene and burnt alive. Despite the source, there has been no confirmation of the story by the coalition.[citation needed]  Currently, the AP stands by this story because they have used Jamil Hussein as a source for over two years.  However, the AP reports filed by Jamil Hussein are invariably stories of atrocities committed by Shiites against Sunnis.[who?]\\\\c\\\\cThroughout the entire Iraq war there have been numerous human rights abuses on all sides of the conflict.\\\\c\\\\cWARNING: These links have graphic content depicting a decapitation;\\\\c\\\\csome of the most publicized abuses include:\\\\c\\\\cAbu Ghraib torture and prisoner abuse\\\\c\\\\cHaditha killings - alleged murder of 24 civilians, including women and children (Under investigation)\\\\c\\\\cIshaqi incident  - alleged murder of 11 civilians, including five children (Under investigation)\\\\c\\\\cHamadiya incident - alleged kidnapping and murder of an Iraqi man named Hashim Ibrahim Awad (Under investigation)\\\\c\\\\cMahmudiyah incident - alleged gang-rape and murder of a 14 year old girl, the murder of her parents and 7 year old sister.

The first two groups have repeatedly boasted about massive car bombs and suicide bombs in mosques, markets, bus stations and other civilian areas. Such acts are war crimes and in some cases may constitute crimes against humanity, which are defined as serious crimes committed as part of a widespread or systematic attack against a civilian population.\\\\c\\\\cThe regular Iraqi insurgents and other groups such as the Sunni Islamic militant groups Al-Qaeda in Iraq and Ansar al-Islam are responsible for numerous abuses and killings, including: \\\\c\\\\cKilling over 12,000 Iraqis over the period of January 2005 - June 2006, according to Iraqi Interior Minister Bayan Jabr, giving the first official count for the largest category of victims of bombings, ambushes and other increasingly deadly attacks.  The insurgents have also conducted numerous suicide attacks on the Iraqi civilian population, mostly targeting the majority Shia community, such as the Attack on the Shia district of Sadr City, Baghdad, on 02/07/2006 which claimed at least 66 lives.

It was elected as the location for the G8 summit due to its isolated location, in anticipation of protests such as those in Gleneagles and St Petersburg. The summit site has already been fenced off by  12 km long barrier, costing an approximate EUR 12.4 million.\\\\c\\\\cHeiligendamm, known as White Town by the Sea, also used to be the summer getaway of the Russian imperial family, who also were related to the Dukes of Mecklenburg.

Preparations are nervous on both sides: 16,000 policemen are deployed to protect the heads of state and government, the 12 kilometers long steel fence has been built around Heiligendamm for the price of 12.4 million Euro, while ATTAC Germany has chartered three trains to get as many discontented citizens as possible from the farther parts of Germany and nearby countries to what is expected to be this year\\\\s biggest unified demonstration against G8, along with numerous buses organised by various groups and political parties. The main demonstration, taking place June 2, 2007 in the nearby big city of Rostock, is the starting event for a whole week of protests and blockades. While organisers expected up to 80,000 participants, police put the figure at an estimated 25,000.  Anticipation is high by protesters for a strengthening of the anti-globalisation movement.  As at previous G8 summits, some protests have turned into violent riots. Towards the end of the June 2 protest, violent clashes between protesters and the police, though essentially limited to a small area at the harbour, was initially reported to have injured nearly 1000 people (433 German police officers, 30-33 of them requiring hospitalisation, and 520 protesters, 20 requiring hospitalisation). Later, these figures were disputed, and the number of police requiring hospitalisation was corrected to 2. According to police estimates, 2000 autonomists led the riots, setting fire to a total of 3 cars and setting up make-shift barricades; many peaceful protesters fled the scene in panic . 128 protesters were detained, but arrest warrants were only issued for 10; the other were either set free due to lack of evidence or are pending review of evidence.\\\\c\\\\cA protest also occurred on 2 June 2007 on the river bank opposite the Houses of Parliament in London, principally a reminder of the G8\\\\s previous (and, as the protestors saw them, unfulfilled) promises on debt relief, entitled G8 – The World Can\\\\t Wait and Wake Up To Poverty.  It was a static protest, with small marches converging on in from Lambeth Park and Methodist Central Hall, on a route starting at the foot of Victoria Tower, along the riverbank of Victoria Tower Gardens, the north side of Lambeth Bridge, and the southern riverbank opposite Parliament as far as (but not including) Westminster Bridge.  This principally involved the protesters setting off alarm clocks at 2pm as a wakeup call to the G8, and passed without incident\\\\c\\\\cG8 leaders reach agreement on a deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\\n']"]},"execution_count":151,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 6.31 ms (started: 2022-05-20 18:29:02 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["docs_clusters[:5]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":50,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653071343001,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"F8vKKb6hvdBk","outputId":"a450d6c1-a2f2-4b45-ee3a-9f59334707fd"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["1454"]},"execution_count":152,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 3.29 ms (started: 2022-05-20 18:29:02 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["len(docs_clusters)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":14,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653071343460,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"aDLloEv0ysq2","outputId":"583dcfc4-f94e-4f54-dce5-ae064e0455f7"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 160 ms (started: 2022-05-20 18:29:02 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["output_str = []\n","for idx in range(len(docs_clusters)):\n","    single_sent = docs_clusters[idx].split('\\\\c\\\\c')\n","    num_articles = math.ceil(len(single_sent)/10) #

As the leader of the Bolivarian Revolution, Chávez promotes his vision of democratic socialism, Latin American integration, and anti-imperialism.  He is also an ardent critic of neoliberal globalization and  US foreign policy..\\n\\nA career military officer, Chávez founded the leftist Fifth Republic Movement after orchestrating a failed 1992 coup d\\\\état against former president Carlos Andrés Pérez.  Chávez was elected President in 1998 on promises of aiding Venezuela's poor majority, and was reelected in 2000. Domestically, Chávez has launched massive Bolivarian Missions, whose goals are to combat disease, illiteracy, malnutrition, poverty, and other social ills. Abroad, Chávez has acted against the Washington Consensus by supporting alternative models of economic development, and has advocated cooperation among the world's poor nations, especially those in Latin America..\\n\\nChávez's reforms have evoked exceptional controversy in Venezuela and abroad, receiving both criticism and praise. Venezuelans are split between those who say he has empowered the poor and stimulated economic growth, and those who say he is autocratic and has mismanaged the economy. Some foreign governments view Chávez as a threat to global oil prices and regional stability, while others welcome his bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements.\\n\\nIn May 2006, he was named one of Time magazine's 100 most influential people..\\n\\nChávez was born on July 28, 1954 in the town of Sabaneta, Barinas. The second son of two schoolteachers, Hugo de los Reyes Chávez and Elena Frías de Chávez, he is of mixed  Amerindian, African, and Spanish descent. Chávez was raised in a thatched palm leaf house near Sabaneta. At an early age, Chávez was sent to Sabaneta with his older brother Adán to live with his paternal grandmother, Rosa Inés Chávez. There, Chávez pursued hobbies such as painting, singing, and baseball, while also attending elementary school at the Julián Pino School. He was later forced to relocate to the town of Barinas to attend high school at the Daniel Florencio O\\\\Leary School.\\n\\nAt age seventeen, Chávez enrolled at the Venezuelan Academy of Military Sciences. After graduating in 1975 as a sub-lieutenant with a degree in Military Arts and Science, Chávez entered military service for several months. He was then allowed to pursue graduate studies in political science at Caracas\\\\ Simón Bolívar University, but left without a degree.\\n\\nOver the course of his college years, Chávez and fellow students developed a fervently left-nationalist doctrine that they termed Bolivarianism, inspired by the Pan-Americanist philosophies of 19th-century Venezuelan revolutionary Simón Bolívar, the influence of former Peruvian President Juan Velasco Alvarado and the teachings of various socialist and communist leaders. Chávez engaged in sporting events and cultural activities during these years as well. Notably, Chávez played both baseball and softball with the Criollitos de Venezuela, progressing with them to the Venezuelan National Baseball Championships in 1969. Chávez also authored numerous poems, stories and theatrical pieces..\\n\\nUpon completing his studies, Chávez initially entered active-duty military service as a member of a counter insurgency battalion stationed in Barinas. Chávez's military career lasted 17 years, during which time he held a variety of post, command, and staff positions, eventually rising to the rank of lieutenant colonel. Chávez also held a series of teaching and staffing positions at the Military Academy of Venezuela, where he was first acknowledged by his peers for his fiery lecturing style and radical critique of Venezuelan government and society. At this time, Chávez established the Revolutionary Bolivarian Movement-200 (MBR-200). Afterwards, he rose to fill a number of sensitive high-level positions in Caracas and was decorated several times..\\n\\nAfter an extended period of popular dissatisfaction and economic decline under the administration of President Carlos Andrés Pérez and the violent repression known as El Caracazo,  Chávez made extensive preparations for a military coup d\\\\état. Initially planned for December, Chávez delayed the MBR-200 coup until the early twilight hours of February 4, 1992. On that date, five army units under Chávez's command barreled into urban Caracas with the mission of assaulting and overwhelming key military and communications installations throughout the city, including the Miraflores presidential palace, the defense ministry, La Carlota military airport, and the Historical Museum. Chávez's ultimate goal was to intercept and take custody of Pérez, who was returning to Miraflores from an overseas trip.\\n\\nChávez held the loyalty of less than 10% of Venezuela's military forces; still, numerous betrayals, defections, errors, and other unforeseen circumstances soon left Chávez and a small group of rebels cut off in the Historical Museum, without any means of conveying orders to their network of spies and collaborators spread throughout Venezuela. Further, Chávez's allies were unable to broadcast their prerecorded tapes on the national airwaves in which Chávez planned to issue a general call for a mass civilian uprising against Pérez. As the coup unfolded, the coup plotters were unable to capture Pérez: fourteen soldiers were killed, and 50 soldiers and some 80 civilians injured in the ensuing violence.  Nevertheless, rebel forces in other parts of Venezuela made advances and were ultimately able to take control of such large cities as Valencia, Maracaibo, and Maracay with the help of spontaneous civilian aid. Chávez's forces, however, had failed to take Caracas.\",\n","  \"Chávez, alarmed, soon gave himself up to the government. He was then allowed to appear on national television to call for all remaining rebel detachments in Venezuela to cease hostilities. When he did so, Chávez famously quipped on national television that he had only failed por ahora—for the moment. Chávez was catapulted into the national spotlight, with many poor Venezuelans seeing him as a figure who had stood up against government corruption and kleptocracy.  Chávez was sent to Yare prison; meanwhile, Pérez, the coup's intended target, was impeached a year later. While in prison, Chávez developed a carnosity of the eye, which spread to his iris. The clarity of his eyesight was slowly corrupted; despite treatments and operations, Chávez's eyesight was permanently damaged.\\n\\nTemplate:ChavezElections1998.\\n\\nAfter a two-year imprisonment, Chávez was pardoned by President Rafael Caldera in 1994. Upon his release, Chávez reconstituted the MBR-200 as the Fifth Republic Movement (MVR—Movimiento Quinta República, with the V representing the Roman numeral five). Later, in 1998, Chávez began to campaign for the presidency. In working to gain the trust of voters, Chávez drafted an agenda that drew heavily on his ideology of Bolivarianism. Chávez and his followers described their aim as laying the foundations of a new republic to replace the existing one, which they cast as party-dominated; the current constitution, they argued, was no more than the juridico-political embodiment of puntofijismo,\\\\ the country's traditional two-party patronage system. Controversially, foreign banks—including Spain's Banco Bilbao Vizcaya Argentaria (BBVA) and Banco Santander (BSCH), each the owner of one of Venezuela's largest banks—illicitly funneled millions of dollars into Chávez's campaign..\\n\\nChávez utilized his charisma and flamboyant public speaking style—noted for its abundance of colloquialisms and ribald manner—on the campaign trail to win the trust and favor of a primarily poor and working class following. By May 1998, Chávez's support had risen to 30% in polls, and by August he was registering 39%. Chávez went on to win the Carter Center-endorsed 1998 presidential election on December 6, 1998 with 56% of the vote..\\n\\nChávez took the presidential oath of office on February 2, 1999 with a mandate to reverse Venezuela's economic decline and strengthen the role of the state in the economy. Chávez's first few months in office were dedicated primarily to dismantling what his supporters deemed puntofijismo via new legislation and constitutional reform, while his secondary focus was on immediately allocating more government funds to new social programs..\\n\\nHowever, as a recession triggered by historically low oil prices and soaring international interest rates rocked Venezuela, the shrunken federal treasury provided very little of the resources Chávez required for his promised massive anti-poverty measures. Consequently, in April 1999 Chávez set his eyes upon the one Venezuelan institution that was costly for the government but did little for the systematic social development that Chávez desired: the military. Chávez ordered all branches of the military to devise programs to combat poverty and to further civic and social development in Venezuela's vast slum and rural areas. This civilian-military program was launched as Plan Bolivar 2000, whose scope included road building, housing construction, and mass vaccination. The plan faltered at the end of 2001 amid revelations of corruption by military officers, including both military officers who later rebelled against the president in April 2002 and officers linked to the president..\\n\\nChávez sharply diverged from previous administrations\\\\ economic policies, terminating their practice of extensively privatizing Venezuela's state-owned holdings, such as the national social security system, holdings in the aluminum industry, and the oil sector.[citation needed] However, although Chávez wished to promote the redistribution of wealth, increased regulation, and social spending, he did not wish to discourage foreign direct investment (FDI). In keeping with his predecessors, Chávez attempted to shore up FDI influxes to prevent an economic crisis of chronic capital flight and inflation..\\n\\nChávez also worked to reduce Venezuelan oil extraction in the hopes of elevating oil prices and, at least theoretically, elevated total oil revenues, thereby boosting Venezuela's severely deflated foreign exchange reserves. He extensively lobbied other OPEC countries to cut their production rates as well. As a result of these actions, Chávez became known as a price hawk in his dealings with the oil industry and OPEC. Chávez also attempted a comprehensive renegotiation of 60-year-old royalty payment agreements with oil giants Philips Petroleum and ExxonMobil. These agreements had allowed the corporations to pay in taxes as little as 1% of the tens of billions of dollars in revenues they were earning from the Venezuelan oil they were extracting. Afterwards, Chávez stated his intention to complete the nationalization of Venezuela's oil resources. Although unsuccessful in his attempts to renegotiate with the oil corporations, Chávez focused on his stated goal of improving both the fairness and efficiency of Venezuela's formerly lax tax collection and auditing system, especially for major corporations and landholders..\\n\\nTemplate:ChavezElections1999.\\n\\nNevertheless, by mid-1999, Chávez was incensed by his administration's setbacks in enacting his much-promised anti-poverty initiatives. The National Assembly's opposition members impeded the legislation of his political allies. Chávez moved to bypass such opposition by approving the scheduling of two fresh national elections for July 1999—just months after Chávez's presidential election. The first was a nationwide referendum to determine whether a national constitutional assembly should be created. The assembly was tasked with framing a new Venezuelan constitution that hewed more closely to Chávez's own political ideology. A second election was held that elected delegates to this constitutional assembly. The constitutional referendum passed with a CNE-audited 72% yes vote; in the second election, members of Chávez's MVR and select allied parties formed the Polo Patriotico (Patriotic Pole). Chávez's Polo Patriotico went on to win 95% (120 out of the total 131) of the seats in the voter-approved Venezuelan Constitutional Assembly.\",\n","  \"However, in August 1999, the Constitutional Assembly established a special judicial emergency committee with the power to remove judges without consulting with other branches of government—over 190 judges were eventually suspended on charges of corruption. In the same month, the Constitutional Assembly declared a legislative emergency, resulting in a seven-member committee that was tasked with conducting the legislative functions ordinarily carried out by the National Assembly. Legislative opposition to Chávez's policies was immediately disabled. Meanwhile, the Constitutional Assembly prohibited the National Assembly from holding meetings of any sort..\\n\\nThe Constitutional Assembly itself drafted the new 1999 Venezuelan Constitution. With 350 articles, the document was, as drafted, one of the world's lengthiest constitutions. It first changed the country's official name from Republic of Venezuela to Bolivarian Republic of Venezuela.  It also increased the presidential term of office from five to six years, allowed for two consecutive presidential terms rather than one, introduced a presidential two-term limit, and introduced provisions for national presidential recall referenda—that is, Venezuelan voters gained the right to remove the president from office before the expiration of his presidential term.  Such referenda can only be activated by a petition to do so with the required number of signatures. The presidency was also dramatically strengthened, with the power to dissolve the National Assembly on certain conditions. The new constitution converted the formerly bicameral National Assembly into a unicameral legislature, and stripped it of many of its former powers. Provisions were also made for a new position, the Public Defender, an office with the authority to check the activities of the presidency, the National Assembly, and the constitution. Chávez characterized the Public Defender as the guardian of the moral branch of the new Venezuelan government, tasked with defending public and moral interests. Lastly, the Venezuelan judiciary was reformed. Judges, under the new constitution, were now to be installed after passing public examinations and were not, as in the old manner, to be appointed by the National Assembly..\\n\\nThis new constitution was presented to the national electorate in December 1999 and approved. Over a span of a mere 60 days, the Constitutional Assembly thus framed a document that enshrined as constitutional law most of the structural changes Chávez desired. Chávez stated that such changes were necessary in order to successfully and comprehensively enact his planned social justice programs. He planned to enact sweeping changes in Venezuelan governmental and political structure, and, based on his 1998 campaign pledges, to dramatically open up Venezuelan political discourse to independent and third parties. In the process, Chávez sought to fatally paralyze his AD (Acción Democrática) and COPEI opposition. All of Chávez's aims were, in one move, dramatically furthered.\\n\\nOn December 15 1999, after weeks of heavy rain, statewide mudslides claimed the lives of an estimated 30,000 people. Critics claim Chávez was distracted by the referendum and that the government ignored a civil defense report, calling for emergency measures, issued the day the floods struck. The government rejected these claims. Chávez personally led the relief effort afterwards. Subsequent mudslides in 2000 left 3 dead..\\n\\nTemplate:ChavezElections2000.\\n\\nElections for the new unicameral National Assembly were held on July 30, 2000. During this same election, Chávez himself stood for reelection. Chávez's coalition garnered a commanding two-thirds majority of seats in the National Assembly while Chávez was reelected with 60% of the votes. The Carter Center monitored the 2000 presidential election; their report on that election stated that, due to lack of transparency, CNE partiality, and political pressure from the Chávez government that resulted in unconstitutionally early elections, it was unable to validate the official CNE results. However, they concluded that the presidential election legitimately expressed the will of the people..\\n\\nLater, on December 3, 2000, local elections and a referendum were held. The referendum, backed by Chávez, proposed a law that would force Venezuela's labor unions to hold state-monitored elections.  The referendum was widely condemned by international labor organizations—including the International Labour Organization—as undue government interference in internal union matters; these organizations threatened to apply sanctions on Venezuela..\\n\\nAfter the May and July 2000 elections, Chávez backed the passage of the Enabling Act by the National Assembly. This act allowed Chávez to rule by decree for one year. In November 2001, shortly before the Enabling Act was set to expire, Chávez enacted a set of 49 decrees. These included the Hydrocarbons Law and the Land Law, which are detailed below. Fedecámaras, a national business federation,and the Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela, a federation of labor unions, opposed the approval of the new laws and called for a general business strike on December 10, 2001 in the hope that the President would reconsider his legislative action and, instead, open a debate about those laws. The strike failed to significantly impact Chávez's decision or policies..\\n\\nBy the end of the first three years of his presidency, Chávez had successfully initiated a land transfer program and had introduced several reforms aimed at improving the social welfare of the population.  These reforms entailed the lowering of infant mortality rates; the implementation of a free, government-funded healthcare system; and free education up to the university level. By December of 2001, following Chávez's imposition of capital controls, inflation fell to 13.4% the lowest in 14 years, while economic growth was steady at four percent. Chávez's administration also reported an increase in primary school enrollment by one million students..\\n\\nOn April 9, 2002, CTV leader Carlos Ortega called for a two-day general strike. Approximately 500,000 people took to the streets on April 11, 2002 and marched towards the headquarters of Venezuela's state-owned oil company, Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), in defense of its recently-fired management. The organizers decided to redirect the march to Miraflores, the presidential palace, where a pro-Chávez demonstration was taking place.  Gunfire and violence erupted between two groups of demonstrators, Caracas\\\\ Metropolitan Police (under the control of the oppositionist mayor), and the Venezuelan national guard (under Chávez's command), and snipers were reported from the areas where both opposition and Chávez supporters were concentrated.  Domestic and international observers criticized the Government for excessive abuse of its right to call national broadcasts requiring all broadcast media to cease scheduled programming and transmit the broadcasts in their entirety.  Between April 9 and 11, the government required all radio and TV stations to transmit numerous speeches by President Chávez, other government officials, and other programming favorable to the Government, even shutting the signals of the stations who refused, in an attempt to block coverage of the demonstrations and ensuing violence.\",\n","  \"Then, unexpectedly, Lucas Rincón Romero, commander-in-chief of the Venezuelan armed forces, announced in a broadcast to a nationwide audience that Chávez had tendered his resignation from the presidency. While Chávez was brought to a military base and held there, military leaders appointed the president of the Fedecámaras, Pedro Carmona, as Venezuela's interim president. Carmona's first decree reversed all of the major social and economic policies that comprised Chávez's Bolivarian Revolution, including loosening Chávez's credit controls and ending his oil price quotas by raising production back to pre-Chávez levels. Carmona also dissolved both the National Assembly and the Venezuelan judiciary, while reverting the nation's name back to República de Venezuela..\\n\\nCarmona's decrees were followed by pro-Chávez uprisings and looting across Caracas. Responding to these disturbances, Venezuelan soldiers loyal to Chávez called for massive popular support for a counter-coup. These soldiers later stormed and retook the presidential palace, and retrieved Chávez from captivity. The shortest-lived government in Venezuelan history was thus toppled, and Chávez resumed his presidency on the night of Saturday, April 13, 2002. Following this episode, Rincón was reappointed by Chávez as Commander of the Army, and later as Interior Minister in 2003.  The opposition would later argue that, since Lucas Rincón remained close to the President, there was no coup but a power vacuum once Chávez resigned, despite the succession order being broken..\\n\\nControversy regarding US intervention raged afterwards. The Observer reports Otto Reich told Latin American diplomats the removal of Chavez was not a rupture of democratic rule, as he had resigned and was responsible for his fate\\\\ and that the US would support the Carmona government.After Chávez resumed his presidency in April 2002, he claimed that a plane with U.S. registration numbers had visited and been berthed at Venezuela's Orchila Island airbase, where Chávez had been held captive. On May 14, 2002, Chávez alleged that he had definitive proof of U.S. military involvement in April's coup. He claimed that during the coup Venezuelan radar images had indicated the presence of U.S. military naval vessels and aircraft in Venezuelan waters and airspace. The Guardian published a claim by former US intelligence officer Wayne Madsen alleging U.S. Navy involvement. Senator Christopher Dodd, D-CT, requested an investigation of concerns that Washington appeared to condone the removal of Mr Chávez, which subsequently found that U.S. officials acted appropriately and did nothing to encourage an April coup against Venezuela's president, nor did they provide any naval logistical support. According to Democracy Now!, CIA documents indicate that the Bush administration knew about a plot weeks before the April 2002 military coup.  They cite a document dated 6 April 2002, which says: dissident military factions...are stepping up efforts to organize a coup against President Chávez, possibly as early as this month.  According to William Brownfield, ambassador to Venezuela, the U.S. embassy in Venezuela warned Chávez about a coup plot in April 2002.  Further, the United States Department of State and the investigation by the Office of the Inspector General found no evidence that U.S. assistance programs in Venezuela, including those funded by the National Endowment for Democracy (NED), were inconsistent with U.S. law or policy or . directly contributed, or was intended to contribute, to [the coup d\\\\état]..\\n\\nChávez also claimed, during the coup's immediate aftermath, that the U.S. was still seeking his overthrow. On October 6, 2002, he stated that he had foiled a new coup plot, and on October 20, 2002, he stated that he had barely escaped an assassination attempt while returning from a trip to Europe.  During that period, the US Ambassador to Venezuela warned the Chávez administration of two potential assassination plots..\\n\\nFollowing his return to office, Chávez quickly took steps to secure support for his government. First, Chávez fired sixty generals and completely replaced the upper echelons of Venezuela's armed forces, substituting them with personnel that could be described as either more complacent, or more loyal to the state, depending on one's political affiliation. Chávez also sought to strengthen support among rank and file soldiers. He boosted support programs, employment, and benefits for veterans, while promulgating new civilian-military development initiatives..\\n\\nHowever, only a few months would pass after the April 2002 coup before the Chávez presidency would enter another crisis. Chávez, outraged by the coup and seeking more funds for his social programs, moved in late 2002 to implement total control over the PDVSA and its revenues. As a result, for two months following December 2, 2002, Chávez faced a strike organized by the resistant PDVSA management who sought to force Chávez out of office by completely removing his access to the all-important government oil revenue. The strike, led by a coalition of labor unions, industrial magnates, and oil workers, sought to halt the activities of the PDVSA. As a result, Venezuela ceased exporting its former daily average of 2,800,000 barrels (450,000 m3) of oil and oil derivatives. Hydrocarbon shortages soon erupted throughout Venezuela, with long lines forming at petrol-filling stations. Gasoline imports were soon required. Alarmed, Chávez responded by firing PDVSA's anti-Chávez upper-echelon management and dismissing 18,000 skilled PDVSA employees. Chávez justified this by alleging their complicity in gross mismanagement and corruption in their handling of oil revenues, while opposition supporters of the fired workers stated that his actions were politically-motivated..\\n\\nIn 2003 and 2004 Chávez launched a number of social and economic campaigns as he struggled to maintain popular support. In July 2003 he launched Mission Robinson, billed as a campaign aimed at providing free reading, writing and arithmetic lessons to the more than 1.5 million Venezuelan adults who were illiterate prior to his 1999 election. On October 12, 2003, Chávez initiated Mission Guaicaipuro, a program billed as protecting the livelihood, religion, land, culture, and rights of Venezuela's indigenous peoples. In late 2003, the Venezuelan president launched Mission Sucre, with the stated intent of providing free higher education to the two million adult Venezuelans who had not completed their elementary-level education. In November 2003, Chávez announced Mission Ribas, with the promise of providing remedial education and diplomas for Venezuela's five million high school dropouts. On the first anniversary of Mission Robinson's establishment, Chávez stated in Caracas's Teresa Carreño theater to an audience of 50,000 formerly illiterate Venezuelans, in a year, we have graduated 1,250,000 Venezuelans. Nevertheless, there were also significant setbacks. Notably, the inflation rate rocketed to 31% in 2002 and remained at the high level of 27% in 2003, causing a great deal of hardship for the poor..\\n\\nIn May 9, 2004, a group of 126 Colombians were captured during a raid of two farms near Caracas. The Colombians were outfit in Venezuelan military uniforms and testified that, once they arrived in Venezuela after receiving promises of legal employment, they were then hired for military action against Venezuelan regulars. The farm was owned by a Cuban anti-Fidel Castro exile and a leader in the unsuccessful 2002 coup.  Chávez soon levelled accusations of the attempted formation of a foreign-funded paramilitary force who intended to violently overthrow his rule. These events merely served to further the extreme and violent polarization of Venezuelan society between pro- and anti-Chávez camps. Chávez's allegations of a putative 2004 coup attempt continue to stir controversy and doubts to this day. In October 2005, 27 of the accused Colombians were found guilty, while the rest were released and deported..\\n\\nTemplate:ChavezElections2004.\\n\\nIn early and mid-2003, Súmate, an opposition-aligned volunteer civilian voter rights organization, began the process of collecting the millions of signatures needed to activate the presidential recall provision provided for in Chávez's 1999 Constitution. In August 2003, around 3.2 million signatures were presented, but these were rejected by the pro-Chávez majority in the Consejo Nacional Electoral (CNE; National Electoral Council) on the grounds that many had been collected before the mid-point of Chávez's presidential term. Reports then began to emerge among opposition and international news outlets that Chávez had begun to act punitively against those who had signed the petition, while pro-Chávez individuals stated that they had been coerced by employers into offering their signatures at their workplaces. In November 2003, the opposition collected an entirely new set of signatures, with 3.6 million names produced over a span of four days. Riots erupted nationwide as allegations of fraud were made by Chávez against the signature collectors.\",\n","  \"The provision in the Constitution allowing for a presidential recall requires the signatures of 20% of the electorate in order to effect a recall.  Further, the cédulas (national identity card numbers) and identities of petition signers are not secret, and in fact were made public by Luis Tascón, a member of the Venezuelan National Assembly representing Chávez\\\\ party (Fifth Republic Movement - MVR) and the Communist Party of Venezuela of Táchira state.  The government was accused of increasing the voter rolls by giving citizenship to illegal immigrants and refugees, and the opposition claimed that it was a citizenship for votes program.  Voter registration increased by about 2 million people ahead of the referendum, which in effect raised the threshold of the 20% of the electorate needed to effect a recall..\\n\\nCredible anecdotal evidence emerged that Chávez and his allies were penalizing signers of the publicly posted petition by denying them government jobs and services. Charges were made of summary dismissals from government ministries, PDVSA, the state-owned water corporation, the Caracas Metro, and public hospitals controlled by Chávez's political allies. Finally, after opposition leaders submitted to the CNE a valid petition with 2,436,830 signatures that requested a presidential recall referendum, a recall referendum was announced on June 8, 2004 by the CNE. Chávez and his political allies responded to this by mobilizing supporters to encourage rejection of the recall with a no vote.\\n\\nThe recall vote itself was held on August 15, 2004. A record number of voters turned out to defeat the recall attempt with a 59% no vote.\\n\\nThe election was overseen by the Carter Center and the Organization of American States, and was certified by them as fair and open..\\n\\nEuropean Union observers did not attend, saying too many restrictions had been placed on their participation by the government. Critics called the results fraudulent, citing documents which indicated that the true results were the complete opposite of the reported ones, and raising questions about the government's ownership of voting machines.  Massive fraud was alleged and the conclusions of former U.S. President Jimmy Carter were questioned, although five other opposition polls showed a Chávez victory..\\n\\nA jubilant Chávez pledged to redouble his efforts against both poverty and imperialism, while promising to foster dialogue with his opponents. Chávez's government subsequently charged the founders of Súmate with treason and conspiracy for receiving foreign funds, earmarked for voter education, from the United States Department of State through the National Endowment for Democracy, triggering commentary from human rights organizations and the U.S.   The trial has been postponed several times.  A program called Mission Identity, to fast track voter registration of immigrants to Venezuela — including Chávez supporters benefiting from his subsidies — has been put in place prior to the upcoming 2006 presidential elections..\\n\\nIn the aftermath of his referendum victory, Chávez's primary objectives of fundamental social and economic transformation and redistribution accelerated dramatically. Chávez himself placed the development and implementation of the Bolivarian Missions once again at the forefront of his political agenda. Sharp increases in global oil prices gave Chávez access to billions of dollars in extra foreign exchange reserves. Economic growth picked up markedly, reaching double-digit growth in 2004 and a 9.3% growth rate for 2005..\\n\\nMany new policy initiatives were advanced by Chávez after 2004. In late March 2005, the Chávez government passed a series of media regulations that criminalized broadcasted libel and slander directed against public officials; prison sentences of up to 40 months for serious instances of character defamation launched against Chávez and other officials were enacted. When asked if he would ever actually move to use the 40-month sentence if a media figure insulted him, Chávez remarked that I don\\\\t care if they [the private media] call me names.... As Don Quixote said, If the dogs are barking, it is because we are working.\\\\ Chávez also worked to expand his land redistribution and social welfare programs by authorizing and funding a multitude of new Bolivarian Missions, including Mission Vuelta al Campo; the second and third phases of Mission Barrio Adentro, both first initiated in June 2005 with the stated aim of constructing, funding, and refurbishing secondary (integrated diagnostic center) and tertiary (hospital) public health care facilities nationwide; and Mission Miranda, which established a national citizen's militia. Meanwhile, Venezuela's doctors went on strike, protesting the siphoning of public funds from their existing institutions to these new Bolivarian ones, run by Cuban doctors..\\n\\nChávez focused considerably on Venezuela's foreign relations in 2004 and 2005 via new bilateral and multilateral agreements, including humanitarian aid and construction projects. Chávez has engaged, with varying degrees of success, numerous other foreign leaders, including Argentina's Néstor Kirchner, China's Hu Jintao, Cuba's Fidel Castro and Iran's Mahmoud Ahmadinejad. On March 4, 2005, Chávez publicly declared that the U.S.-backed Free Trade Area of the Americas (FTAA) was dead. Chávez stated that the neoliberal model of development had utterly failed in improving the lives of Latin Americans, and that an alternative, anti-capitalist model would be conceived in order to increase trade and relations between Venezuela, Argentina and Brazil. Chávez also stated his desire that a leftist, Latin American analogue of NATO be established..\\n\\nOver the course of 2004 and 2005, the Venezuelan military under Chávez also began in earnest to reduce weaponry sourcing and military ties with the United States. Chávez's Venezuela is thus increasingly purchasing arms from alternative sources, such as Brazil, Russia, China and Spain. Friction over these sales escalated, and in response Chávez ended cooperation between the militaries of the two countries. He also asked all active-duty U.S. soldiers to leave Venezuela. Additionally, in 2005 Chávez announced the creation of a large military reserve—the Mission Miranda program, which encompasses a militia of 1.5 million citizens—as a defensive measure against foreign intervention or outright invasion. Additionally, in October 2005, Chávez banished the Christian missionary organization New Tribes Mission from the country, accusing it of imperialist infiltration and harboring connections with the CIA. At the same time, he granted inalienable titles to over 6,800 square kilometers of land traditionally inhabited by Amazonian indigenous peoples to their respective resident natives, though this land could not be bought or sold as Western-style title deeds can. Chávez cited these changes as evidence that his revolution was also a revolution for the defense of indigenous rights, such as those promoted by Chávez's Mission Guaicaipuro.\",\n","  \"During this period, Chávez placed much greater emphasis on alternative economic development and international trade models, much of it in the form of extremely ambitious hemisphere-wide international aid agreements. For example, on August 20, 2005, during the first graduation of international scholarship students from Cuba's Latin American School of Medicine, Chávez announced that he would jointly establish with Cuba a second such medical school that would provide tuition-free medical training—an ex gratia project valued at between $20 and 30 billion—to more than 100,000 physicians who would pledge to work in the poorest communities of the Global South. He announced that the project would run for the next decade, and that the new school would include at least 30,000 new places for poor students from both Latin America and the Caribbean..\\n\\nChávez has also taken ample opportunity on the international stage to juxtapose such projects with the manifest results and workings of neoliberal globalization. Most notably, during his speech at the 2005 UN World Summit, he denounced development models that are organized around neoliberal guidelines such as liberalization of capital flows, removal of trade barriers, and privatization as the reason for the developing world's impoverishment. Chávez also went on to warn of an imminent global energy famine brought about by hydrocarbon depletion (based on Hubbert peak theory), stating that we are facing an unprecedented energy crisis.... Oil is starting to become exhausted. Additionally, on November 7, 2005, Chávez referenced the stalling of the FTAA, stating at the Fourth Summit of the Americas, held in Mar del Plata, Argentina, that the great loser today was George W. The man went away wounded. You could see defeat on his face. Chávez took the same opportunity to state that the taste of victory was apparent with regards to the promotion of his own trade alternative, the Bolivarian Alternative for the Americas (ALBA—Alternativa Bolivariana para América), which Venezuela and Cuba inaugurated on December 14, 2004..\\n\\nIn 2005, Chávez demanded the extradition of Luis Posada Carriles, accused of conspiring to bomb Cubana Flight 455. A Texas judge blocked the extradition on the grounds that he could be tortured in Venezuela; the Venezuelan embassy blamed the Department of Homeland Security for refusing to contest such accusations during the trial. Chávez also requested the extradition of former Venezuelan  officers and members of Militares democraticos, Lt. German Rodolfo Varela and Lt. Jose Antonio Colina, who are wanted for bombing the Spanish and Colombian embassies after Chávez made a speech criticizing both governments..\\n\\nThe BBC says that Chavez has made no secret of the fact that he is in favour of amending the constitution so that he can run again for president in 2012.  In spite of a presidential term limit of 12 years, according to The Economist, Chávez often suggests that he will remain in power for 25 years, a claim he denies as a misinterpretation of his intent.[citation needed]  Chávez has said that if the opposition boycotts the 2006 Venezuelan presidential election he might sign a decree calling for a popular referendum - Do you agree that Chavez should run for a third term in 2013?” He is campaigning for re-election in December..\\n\\nIn 2006 Chávez announced Venezuela's bid to win a non-permanent seat on the UN Security Council; Washington officials are encouraging Latin American and Caribbean nations to vote instead for Guatemala. Analysts quoted by Forbes Magazine say that Chávez will offer to supply 20% of China's crude oil needs if Beijing backs Venezuela's bid to join the UN Security Council. In Chile, the press is concerned that Venezuelan grants for flood aid might affect the government's decision about which country to support for admission to the UN Security Council..\\n\\nIn accordance with his foreign policy trends, Chávez has visited several countries in Latin America, as well as Portugal, Belarus, Russia, Qatar, Syria, Iran, Vietnam, Mali and Benin.  At the request of Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, Chávez also attended the 2006 summit of the African Union in Banjul.. He also visited the People's Republic of China and Malaysia..\\n\\nIn a highly controversial speech given to the United Nations General Assembly on 20 September, 2006, Chávez referred to United States President George W. Bush as the Devil (El Diablo). And the devil came here yesterday, said Chávez, referring to Bush's General Assembly speech of the previous day, Yesterday, the devil came here. Right here. Right here. And it smells of sulfur still today, this table that I am now standing in front of. At this point Chavez made the sign of the cross, positioned his hands as if praying and looked slowly up to the ceiling. He continued, Yesterday, ladies and gentlemen, from this rostrum, the president of the United States, the gentleman to whom I refer as the devil, came here, talking as if he owned the world. As the owner of the world. Chávez also cited a book (Hegemony or Survival by Noam Chomsky) on imperialism and said it encapsulated his arguments: The American empire is doing all it can to consolidate its hegemonistic system of domination, and we cannot allow him to do that. We cannot allow world dictatorship to be consolidated.\\n\\nIn response, House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi, an ardent critic of President Bush, called Chavez an everyday thug and not the modern day Simon Bolivar that he fancies himself to be..\\n\\nTemplate:Bolivarian Missions Infobox 1.\\n\\nChávez's domestic policy relies heavily on the Bolivarian Missions, a series of political campaigns aimed at radically altering the economic and cultural landscape of Venezuela\",\n","  \"The Bolivarian Missions have entailed the launching of massive government anti-poverty initiatives, the construction of thousands of free medical clinics for the poor, the institution of educational campaigns that have reportedly made more than one million adult Venezuelans literate, and the enactment of food and housing subsidies. There have been marked improvements in the infant mortality rate between 1998 and 2006..\\n\\nThe Missions have overseen widespread experimentation in what Chávez supporters term citizen- and worker-managed governance, as well as the granting of thousands of free land titles, reportedly to formerly landless poor and indigenous communities. Several allegedly unused estates and factories have been expropriated to provide this land..\\n\\nOn March 2006 the Communal Council Law was approved, whereby communities that decide to organize themselves into a council can be given official state recognition and access to federal funds and loans for community projects. This skips the local and state governments that are perceived as corrupt..\\n\\nChávez has had a combative relationship with the nation's largest trade union confederation, the Confederación de Trabajadores de Venezuela (CTV), which is historically aligned with the Acción Democrática (AD) party. During the December 2000 local elections, Chávez placed a referendum measure on the ballot that would mandate state-monitored elections within unions. The measure, which was condemned by the International Labour Organization (ILO) and International Confederation of Free Trade Unions (ICFTU) as undue interference in internal union matters, passed by a large margin on a very low electoral turnout. In the ensuing CTV elections, Carlos Ortega declared his victory and remained in office as CTV president, while chavista (pro-Chávez) candidates declared fraud..\\n\\nThe Unión Nacional de Trabajadores (UNT—National Union of Workers), a new pro-Chávez union federation, formed in response, and has been growing in membership; it seeks to ultimately supplant the CTV. Several chavista unions have withdrawn from the CTV because of their strident anti-Chávez activism, and have instead affiliated with the UNT. In 2003, Chávez chose to send UNT, rather than CTV, representatives to an annual ILO meeting..\\n\\nFurther augmenting state involvement in Venezuela's economy, Chávez nationalized Venepal, a formerly closed paper and cardboard manufacturing firm, on January 19, 2005. Workers had occupied the factory floor and restarted production, but following a failed deal with management and amidst management threats to liquidate the firm's equipment, Chávez ordered the nationalization, extended a line of credit to the workers, and ordered that the Venezuelan educational missions purchase more paper products from the company..\\n\\nVenezuela is a major producer of oil products, which remain the keystone of the Venezuelan economy. Chávez has gained a reputation as a price hawk in OPEC, pushing for stringent enforcement of production quotas and higher target oil prices.  At a June 2006 meeting, Venezuela was the only OPEC country calling for lowered production to drive oil prices higher. Industry analysts say Venezuela wants lower quotas because, under Chávez's administration, the output of Petróleos de Venezuela S.A. (PDVSA), Venezuela's state-owned oil company, has been reduced by 25% and Venezuela cannot meet its current quota. However, Forbes argues that some oil production numbers are politically motivated, intended to discredit the Venezuelan industry. Nonetheless, Chávez has attempted to broaden Venezuela's customer base, striking joint exploration deals with other developing countries, including Argentina, Brazil, China and India. Record oil prices have meant more funding for social programs, but have left the economy increasingly dependent on both the Chávez government and the oil sector; the private sector's role has correspondingly diminished..\\n\\nChávez has redirected the focus of PDVSA by bringing it more closely under the direction of the Ministry of Energy and Petroleum . He has also attempted to repatriate more oil funds to Venezuela by raising royalty percentages on joint extraction contracts that are payable to Venezuela. Chávez has also explored the liquidation of some or all of the assets belonging to PDVSA's U.S.-based subsidiary, Citgo. The Ministry of Energy and Petroleum has been successful in restructuring Citgo's profit structure, resulting in large increases in dividends and income taxes from PDVSA..\\n\\nDuring Chávez's presidency from 1999 to 2004, per-capita GDP dropped 1–2 %, but with the help of rising oil prices, the end of the oil strike, and strong consumption growth, recent economic activity under Chávez has been robust.  GDP growth rates were 18% in 2004, 9% in 2005, and 9.6% in the first half of 2006, with the private sector growing at a 10.3% clip. From 2004 to the first half of 2006, non-petroleum sectors of the economy showed growth rates greater than 10%. Datos reports real income grew by 137% between 2003 and Q1 2006. Official poverty figures dropped by 4.9%. Some economists argue that this subsidized growth could stop if oil prices decline, and some social scientists and economists claim that the government's reported poverty figures have not fallen in proportion to the country's vast oil revenues in the last two years.\\n\\nThe president of Datos said that, although his surveys showed rising incomes because of subsidies and grants, the number of people in the worst living conditions has grown.  The poor of Venezuela are living much better lately and have increased their purchasing power . [but] without being able to improve their housing, education level, and social mobility, he said. Rather than help [the poor] become stakeholders in the economic system, what [the government has] done is distribute as much oil wealth as possible in missions and social programs.\",\n","  \"According to government figures, unemployment has dropped by 7% since the start of Chávez's presidency.   Venezuela's rate of unemployment dropped to 10% in February 2006 from the 2003 high of 20%, which occurred during a two-month strike and business lockout that shut down the country's oil industry. However, some economists argue that recent job creation may not be permanent, for it relies on an expanded public payroll that will become unaffordable if oil prices fall. According to the Venezuelan government, an unemployed person is a citizen above the age of 15 who has been seeking employment for more than one week. But, according to The Boston Globe, critics say that the government defines informal workers, such as street vendors, as employed, and exclud[es] adults who are studying in missions from unemployment numbers. Critics also point to figures released by the president of the Venezuelan National Statistics Institute, Elías Eljuri, which showed that poverty had actually risen by more than 10 percentage points under Chávez (to 53% in 2004). Chávez called for a new measure of poverty, a social well-being index.  Under this new definition, poverty registers at 40 percent. Eljuri denies changing the statistic and claims it is entirely income excluding social programs.  The World Bank calculated a 10% drop in poverty.\\n\\nAccording to the Banco Central de Venezuela, inflation dropped from 29.9% to 14.4%. During 2005, imported goods were cheaper than commodities made in Venezuela; variability in the price of goods was linked to import performance and exchange stability. In the second quarter of 2006 gross fixed investment was the highest ever recorded by the Banco Central de Venezuela since it started tracking the statistic in 1997..\\n\\nWhile the Venezuelan Government enjoys a windfall of oil profits, the business environment is risky and discourages investment, according to El Universal.  As measured by prices on local stock exchanges, investors are willing to pay on average 16.3 years worth of earnings to invest in Colombia companies, 15.9 in Chile, 11.1 in Mexico, and 10.7 in Brazil, but only 5.8 in Venezuela. The World Economic Forum ranked Venezuela as 82 out of 102 countries on a measure of how favorable investment is for institutions.  In Venezuela, an investor needs an average of 119 days and must complete 14 different proceedings to organize a business, while the avarage in OECD countries is 30 days and six proceedings..\\n\\nPublic spending in Venezuela has broken unprecedented records as measured by local currency Central Bank debt, which could increase inflation..\\n\\nChávez has refocused Venezuelan foreign policy on Latin American economic and social integration by enacting bilateral trade and reciprocal aid agreements, including his so-called oil diplomacy. Chávez stated that Venezuela has a strong oil card to play on the geopolitical stage . He said, It is a card that we are going to play with toughness against the toughest country in the world, the United States. Chávez has focused on a variety of multinational institutions to promote his vision of Latin American integration, including Petrocaribe, Petrosur, and TeleSUR. Bilateral trade relationships with other Latin American countries have also played a major role in his policy, with Chávez increasing arms purchases from Brazil, forming oil-for-expertise trade arrangements with Cuba, funding an ex gratia oil pipeline built to provide discounted natural gas to Colombia,[citation needed] and creating unique barter arrangements that exchange Venezuelan petroleum for cash-strapped Argentina's meat and dairy products. Additionally, Chávez worked closely with other Latin American leaders following the 1997 Summit of the Americas in many areas—especially energy integration—and championed the OAS decision to adopt the Anti-Corruption Convention. Chávez also participates in the United Nations Friends groups for Haiti, and is pursuing efforts to join and engage the Mercosur trade bloc to expand the hemisphere's trade integration prospects..\\n\\nAbroad, Chávez regularly portrays his movement's objectives as being diametrically opposed to neocolonialism and neoliberalism. Chávez has, for example, denounced U.S. foreign policy regarding areas such as Iraq, Haiti, and the Free Trade Area of the Americas. Chávez's warm and public friendship with Cuban President Fidel Castro has markedly compromised the U.S. policy of isolating Cuba diplomatically and economically. Long-standing ties between the U.S. and Venezuelan militaries were also severed by Chávez.  Moreover, his stance as an OPEC price hawk has made him unpopular in the United States. In 2000, Chávez made a ten-day tour of OPEC countries in a bid to promote his policies, becoming the first head of state to meet Saddam Hussein since the Gulf War.\\n\\nChávez's foreign policy conduct and anti-Bush rhetoric has occasionally reached the level of personal attacks. Chávez once referred to U.S. Bush as a pendejo (dumbass), and constantly refers to him as Míster Danger. In a later speech, he made personal remarks regarding Condoleezza Rice, referring to her as a complete illiterate when it comes to comprehending Latin America.   On September 20, 2006 Chavez called Bush the devil.\\n\\nAfter Hurricane Katrina battered the United States’ Gulf Coast in late 2005, the Chávez administration was the first foreign government to offer aid to the devastated regions. The Bush administration opted to refuse this aid. Later during the winter of 2005, various officials in the Northeastern United States signed an agreement with Venezuela to provide discounted heating oil to low income families..\\n\\nThere have also been heated disputes between Chávez and other Latin American leaders, including one with Mexican President Vicente Fox over what Chávez alleged was Fox's support of U.S. trade interests.  The dispute resulted in a strained diplomatic relationship between the two countries.  Another diplomatic row with Colombia, referred to as the Rodrigo Granda affair, occurred in 2004, after the kidnap of Rodrigo Granda, a high ranking member of the political wing of the FARC. In 2001, a dissension with Peru occurred over suspicions that Chávez's administration was protecting and hiding Vladimiro Montesinos, a former Peruvian intelligence director under the Alberto Fujimori administration, wanted for corruption.  Between January and March of 2006, Chávez commented on the candidates of the 2006 Peruvian Presidential election, openly backing Ollanta Humala while referring to Alan García as a thief and a crook.  The Peruvian government therefore admonished Chávez for interfering in Peru's affairs..\\n\\nOn August 3, 2006 Chávez ordered the Venezuelan chargé d\\\\affaires to Israel to return from Tel Aviv to Venezuela, protesting the 2006 Israel-Lebanon conflict. Israel responded by recalling its Israeli ambassador to Venezuela. Chávez made statements comparing Israel to Hitler and their actions to the Holocaust, and blaming the United States.\",\n","  \"He was strongly criticized for trivializing the Holocaust..\\n\\nOn September 19, 2006, Chávez addressed the UN General Assembly, drawing some applause and tentative giggling by calling George Bush the devil. Chávez accused the U.S. government of domination, exploitation and pillage of peoples of the world. At the start of his talk, Chavez held up a book by American writer Noam Chomsky, Hegemony or Survival: America's Quest for Global Dominance, and recommended it to everyone in the General Assembly, as well as to the American people..\\n\\nThe people of the United States should read this ... instead of the watching Superman movies, Chavez later told reporters..\\n\\nChavez also said it was a shame that he did not get the chance to meet with Chomsky before he died (as of 9/23/2006 Noam Chomsky is still alive)..\\n\\nEven before the April 2002 coup, many owners, managers, and commentators working for the five major private mainstream television networks and largest mainstream newspapers had stated their opposition to Chávez's policies. These media outlets have accused the Chávez administration of intimidating their journalists using specially-dispatched gangs.  Chávez in turn alleges that the owners of these networks have primary allegiance not to Venezuela but to the United States, and that they seek the advancement of what he terms neoliberalism via corporate propaganda.\\n\\nThroughout his presidency, Chávez has hosted the live talk show known as Aló Presidente (Hello, President!). The show broadcasts in varying formats on Venezolana de Televisión (VTV—Venezuelan State Television) each Sunday at 11:00 AM. The show features Chávez addressing topics of the day, taking phone calls and live questions from both the studio and broadcast audience, and touring locations where government social welfare programs are active. Additionally, on July 25, 2005, Chávez inaugurated TeleSUR, a proposed pan-American homologue of Al Jazeera that seeks to challenge the present domination of Latin American television news by Univision and the United States-based CNN en Español. Chávez's media policies have contributed to elevated tensions between the United States and Venezuela..\\n\\nChávez's version of Bolivarianism, although drawing heavily from Simón Bolívar's ideals, was also influenced by the writings of Marxist historian Federico Brito Figueroa. Chávez was well acquainted with the various traditions of Latin American socialism espoused by Jorge Eliécer Gaitán and Salvador Allende and from a young age by the Cuban revolutionary doctrine of Che Guevara and Fidel Castro. Other key influences on Chávez's political philosophy include Ezequiel Zamora and Simón Rodríguez. Other indirect influences on Chávez's political philosophy are the writings of Noam Chomsky and the teachings of Jesus as recorded in the Bible (Chávez describes Jesus as the world's first socialist.)  Although Chávez himself refers to his ideology as Bolivarianismo (Bolivarianism), Chávez's supporters and opponents in Venezuela refer to themselves as being either for or against chavismo. Thus, Chávez supporters refer to themselves not as Bolivarians or Bolivarianists, but rather as chavistas..\\n\\nLater in his life, Chávez would acknowledge the role that democratic socialism (a form of socialism that emphasizes grassroots democratic participation) plays in Bolivarianism.  Because his Bolivarianism relies on popular support, Chávez has organized the Bolivarian Circles, which he cites as examples of grassroots and participatory democracy. The circles are charged with such tasks as neighborhood beautification, mass mobilization, lending support to small businesses, and providing basic social services, but critics are suspect of their independence and aims..\\n\\nWith respect to domestic policies, critics report that both corruption and crime are rampant. They also cite a failing infrastructure and public hospitals.   Criticism from Chávez supporters arises from reports that Chávez is not fulfilling his major campaign pledges with respect to labor and land reform..\\n\\nCritics have also charged that the Chávez government has engaged in gigantic fraud during the 2004 recall referendum.  Human rights organizations Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch have documented numerous human rights violations in Venezuela, although these have usually been reports of police misbehaviour and brutality rather than criticism of Chávez's policies.  The Venezuelan police have been criticised for human rights abuse for long before Chávez gained power. The United States government claims that his cooperation in the War on Terrorism is negligible or purposely indifferent with regards to the FARC and ELN; nonetheless, the U.S. government says there is no evidence of a direct link between terrorism and Chávez.\",\n","  \"Several public figures have even gone so far as to call for the assassination of Chávez, most notably US Conservative Christian televangelist Pat Robertson.  Other such requests have been expressed by Venezuelan actor Orlando Urdaneta and former president of Venezuela Carlos Andrés Pérez. The US Ambassador to Venezuela between 2001 and 2004, Charles Shapiro, also reported to the Chávez administration two potential assassination plots..\\n\\nChavez has been accussed of concentrating power of judicial and legislative branches..\\n\\nHugo Chávez has been married twice. He first wedded Nancy Colmenares, a woman from a poor family originating in Chávez's own hometown of Sabaneta. Chávez and Colmenares remained married for eighteen years, during which time they had three children: Rosa Virginia, María Gabriela, and Hugo Rafael. They separated soon after Chávez's 1992 coup attempt.  During his first marriage, Chávez also had an affair with young historian Herma Marksman; they had a relationship which lasted nine years, but ended. Chávez is separated from his second wife, journalist Marisabel Rodríguez de Chávez. Through that marriage, Chávez had another daughter, Rosa Inés. Chávez has one granddaughter, Gabriela..\\n\\nChávez is of Roman Catholic extraction.[citation needed] He has had a series of disputes with both the Venezuelan Catholic clergy and Protestant church hierarchies. He has traditionally kept his own faith a private matter, but over the course of his presidency, Chávez has become increasingly open to discussing his religious views, stating that both his faith and his interpretation of Jesus\\\\ personal life and ideology have had a profound impact on his leftist and progressivist views.He often invokes God and asks for prayer in speeches, as he did when he asked Venezuelans to pray for Fidel Castro..\\n\\nUnited States Representative Charles Rangel (D) also said in a press release that an attack on Bush is attack on all of us (Americans).\"],\n"," [\"The Iraq War (2003 to the present), also known as the Second Gulf War is an ongoing war started by the 2003 invasion of Iraq. Following the successful overthrow of the then Iraq President Saddam Hussein, the subsequent occupation of Iraq by a United States-led coalition has resulted in ongoing asymmetric warfare between an insurgency and the occupying coalition forces and sectarian violence between Sunni and Shia Iraqis.   The causes and consequences of the war remain controversial.\\n\\nPrior to invasion, the United States and other coalition forces involved in the 1991 Persian Gulf War had been engaged in a low-level conflict with Iraq, by enforcing the two Iraqi no-fly zones in the north and the south of the country. Iraqi air-defense installations repeatedly targeted American and British air patrols and were often engaged by the coalition aircraft shortly afterwards. Approximately nine months after the 9/11 attacks, the U.S. initiated Operation Southern Focus as a change to its response strategy, by increasing the overall number of missions and selecting targets throughout the no-fly zones in order to disrupt the military command structure in Iraq..\\n\\nThe weight of bombs dropped increased from none in March 2002 and 0.3 in April 2002 to between 8 and 14 tons per month in May-August, reaching a pre-war peak of 54.6 tons in September - prior to Congress\\\\ 11 October authorization of the invasion. In retaliation for the Iraqi's now-daily air defense attacks on coalition aircraft, the September attacks included a 5 September 100-aircraft attack on the main air defence site in western Iraq. According to an editorial by Michael Smith for the New Statesman, this was Located at the furthest extreme of the southern no-fly zone, far away from the areas that needed to be patrolled to prevent attacks on the Shias; it was destroyed not because it was a threat to the patrols, but to allow allied special forces operating from Jordan to enter Iraq undetected. military personnel stationed at Southern Watch headquarters during this time, recall that this attack, on this particular Iraqi air defense unit, was taken solely in reaction to Iraq's continued attack on coalition aircraft operating in compliance with the UN-mandated overflights of the Iraq no-fly zone..\\n\\nThe 2003 invasion of Iraq began on March 20, under the U.S. codename Operation Iraqi Freedom. military's codename for their participation in the invasion was called Operation Telic.  The coalition forces cooperated with Kurdish peshmerga forces in the north. Approximately forty other nations, in the U.S. dubbed coalition of the willing, also participated by providing equipment, services and security as well as special forces. This March 20, 2003, invasion marked the beginning of what is commonly referred to as the Iraq War..\\n\\nShortly after the invasion, the multinational coalition created the Coalition Provisional Authority (CPA) سلطة الائتلاف الموحدة as a transitional government of Iraq until the establishment of a democratic government.  Citing UN Security Council Resolution 1483 (2003), and the laws of war, the CPA vested itself with executive, legislative, and judicial authority over the Iraqi government from the period of the CPA's inception on April 21, 2003, until its dissolution on June 28, 2004..\\n\\nThe CPA was originally headed by Jay Garner, a former U.S. military officer, but his appointment lasted for only a brief time. After Garner resigned, President Bush appointed L. Paul Bremer as the head the CPA and he served until the CPA's dissolution in July 2004..\\n\\nAnother group created in the spring of 2003 was the Iraq Survey Group (ISG). This was a fact-finding mission sent by the multinational force in Iraq after the 2003 Invasion of Iraq to find weapons of mass destruction (WMD) programs developed by Iraq under the regime of former Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. Its final report is commonly called the Duelfer Report. It consisted of a 1,400-member international team organized by The Pentagon and CIA to hunt for suspected stockpiles of WMD, such as chemical and biological agents, and any supporting research programs and infrastructure that could be used to develop WMD..\\n\\nOn May 1, 2003, President Bush staged a dramatic visit to the aircraft carrier USS Abraham Lincoln while the ship was a few miles west of San Diego.  The Lincoln was on its way home to Everett, Washington from a long deployment which had included service in the Persian Gulf.  The visit climaxed at sunset with his now well-known Mission Accomplished speech.  This nationally-televised speech was delivered before the sailors and airmen on the flight deck.  Bush essentially declared victory at this time due to the defeat of Iraq's conventional forces (even though Saddam Hussein was at large and significant pockets of resistance remained)..\\n\\nAfter Bush's speech in May of 2003, the coalition military noticed a gradually increasing flurry of attacks on their troops in various regions, especially the Sunni Triangle. In the initial chaos after the fall of the Iraqi government, there was massive looting of infrastructure, including government buildings, official residences, museums, banks, and military depots. According to The Pentagon, 250,000 tons (of 650,000 tons total) of ordnance was looted, providing a significant source of ammunition for the Iraqi insurgency. The hundreds of weapons caches already created by the conventional Iraqi army and Republican Guard further strengthened these looted supplies for the insurgents..\\n\\nAt first the resistance stemmed from fedayeen and loyalists of Saddam Hussein or the Ba\\\\ath Party,[citation needed] but soon religious radicals and Iraqis angered by the occupation contributed to the insurgency. The insurgents are generally known to the Coalition forces as Anti-Iraqi Forces\",\n","  \"The initial insurgency in Iraq was concentrated in, but not limited to, an area referred to by Western media and the occupying forces as the Sunni triangle. This location includes Baghdad.  The three provinces that had the highest number of attacks were Baghdad, Anbar, and Salah Ad Din. -Those 3 provinces account for 35% of the population, but are responsible for 73% of U.S. military deaths (as of December 5, 2006), and an even higher percentage of recent U.S. military deaths (about 80%) .  This resistance has been described as a type of guerrilla warfare. Insurgent tactics include mortars, missiles, suicide bombers, snipers (cf. Juba, the Baghdad Sniper), improvised explosive devices (IEDs), roadside bombs, car bombs, small arms fire (usually with assault rifles), and RPGs (rocket-propelled grenades), as well as sabotage against the oil, water, and electrical infrastructure..\\n\\nThe post-invasion environment began after the Hussein regime had been overthrown. It centers on Coalition and U.N. efforts to establish a stable democratic state capable of defending itself and holding itself together  and overcoming insurgent attacks and internal divisions..\\n\\nCoalition military forces launched several operations around Tigris River peninsula and in the Sunni Triangle. A series of similar operations were launched throughout the summer in the Sunni Triangle. Toward the end of 2003, the intensity and pace of insurgent attacks began to increase. A sharp surge in guerrilla attacks ushered in an insurgent effort that was termed the Ramadan Offensive, as it coincided with the beginning of the Muslim holy month of Ramadan. Coalition forces brought to bear the use of air power for the first time since the end of the invasion. Suspected ambush sites and mortar launching positions struck from the air and with artillery fire. Surveillance of major routes, patrols, and raids on suspected insurgents were stepped up. In addition, two villages, including Saddam’s birthplace of al-Auja and the small town of Abu Hishma were wrapped in barbed wire and carefully monitored.\\n\\nHowever, the failure to restore basic services to above pre-war levels, where over a decade of sanctions, bombing, corruption, and decaying infrastructure had left major cities functioning at much-reduced levels, also contributed to local anger at the IPA government headed by an executive council. On July 2 2003, President Bush declared that American troops would remain in Iraq in spite of the attacks, challenging the insurgents with My answer is, bring em on, a line the President later expressed misgivings about having used.  In the summer of 2003, the multinational forces also focused on hunting down the remaining leaders of the former regime. On July 22, 2003, during a raid by the U.S. 101st Airborne Division and soldiers from Task Force 20, Saddam Hussein's sons (Uday and Qusay) and one of his grandsons were killed. In all, over 300 top leaders of the former regime were killed or captured, as well as numerous lesser functionaries and military personnel..\\n\\nIn the wave of intelligence information fueling the raids on remaining Ba\\\\ath Party members connected to insurgency, Saddam Hussein himself was captured on December 13 2003 on a farm near Tikrit in Operation Red Dawn. The operation was conducted by the U.S. Army's 4th Infantry Division and members of Task Force 121.\\n\\nWith the capture of Saddam and a drop in the number of insurgent attacks, some concluded the multinational forces were prevailing in the fight against the insurgency. With the weather growing cooler, Coalition forces were able to operate in full armor which reduced their casualty rate.[citation needed] The provisional government began training the New Iraqi Security forces intended to defend the country, and the United States promised over $20 billion in reconstruction money in the form of credit against Iraq's future oil revenues. Of this, less than half a billion dollars had been spent in 10 months after it had been promised.[citation needed]  Oil revenues were also used for rebuilding schools and for work on the electrical and refining infrastructure..\\n\\nShortly after the capture of Saddam, elements left out of the Coalition Provisional Authority began to agitate for elections and the formation of an Iraqi Interim Government. Most prominent among these was the Shia cleric Ali al-Sistani. The Coalition Provisional Authority opposed allowing democratic elections at this time, preferring instead to eventually hand-over power to the Interim Iraqi Government. Due to the internal fight for power in the new Iraqi government more insurgents stepped up their activities. The two most turbulent centers were the area around Fallujah and the poor Shia sections of cities from Baghdad(Sadr City) to Basra in the south..\\n\\nThe start of 2004 was marked by a relative lull in violence. Insurgent forces reorganized during this time, studying the multinational forces\\\\ tactics and planning a renewed offensive. Guerrilla attacks were less intense. However, in late 2004 foreign fighters from around the Middle East as well as al-Qaeda in Iraq (an affiliated al-Qaeda group), led by Abu Musab al-Zarqawi would help to drive the insurgency..\\n\\nAs the insurgent activity increased, there was a distinct change in targeting from the coalition forces towards the new Iraqi Security Forces, as hundreds of Iraqi civilians and police were killed over the next few months in a series of massive bombings.  One hypothesis for these increased bombings is that the relevance of Saddam Hussein and his followers was diminishing in direct proportion to the influence of radical Islamists, both foreign and Iraqi.  An organized Sunni insurgency, with deep roots and both nationalist and Islamist motivations, was becoming more powerful throughout Iraq. The Mahdi Army also began launching attacks on coalition targets in an attempt to seize control from Iraqi security forces. The southern and central portions of Iraq were beginning to erupt in urban guerrilla combat as multinational forces attempted to keep control and prepared for a counteroffensive.\\n\\nThe coalition and the Coalition Provisional Authority decided to face the growing insurgency with a pair of assaults: one on Fallujah, the center of the Mohammed's Army of Al-Ansar, and another on Najaf, home of an important mosque that had become the focal point for the Mahdi Army and its activities\",\n","  \"On March 31, 2004 - Iraqi insurgents in Fallujah ambushed a convoy containing four American private military contractors from Blackwater USA who were conducting delivery for food caterers ESS.\\n\\nThe four armed contractors, Scott Helvenston, Jerko Zovko, Wesley Batalona and Michael Teague, were dragged from their cars, beaten, and set ablaze. Their burned corpses were then dragged through the streets before being hung over a bridge crossing the Euphrates..\\n\\nPhotos of the event were released to news agencies worldwide, causing a great deal of indignation and moral outrage in the United States, and prompting the announcement of a upcoming pacification of the city..\\n\\nAfter this incident, the 1st Marine Expeditionary Force began plans to re-establish a coalition presence in Fallujah. On April 4, the multinational forces began assaults to clear Fallujah of insurgents. On April 9, the multinational force allowed more than 70,000 women, children and elderly residents to leave the besieged city, reportedly also allowing males of military age to leave. Meanwhile, insurgents were taking advantage of the lull in combat to prepare defenses for a second assault. On April 10, the military declared a unilateral truce to allow for humanitarian supplies to enter Fallujah. Troops pulled back to the outskirts of the city; local leaders reciprocated the ceasefire, although lower-level intense fighting on both sides continued..\\n\\nThe usage by the U.S. of white phosphorus in Fallujah attracted controversy. In the documentary Fallujah: The Hidden Massacre, aired on the Italian state television network RAI, a former soldier testified I saw the burned bodies of women and children. The phosphorus explodes and forms a plume. Who ever is within a 150 metre radius has no hope.     The U.S. State department first dismissed such claims,  but was later corrected in other reports. Lt Col Barry Venable stated to the BBC, it is an incendiary weapon and may be used against enemy combatants. According to Protocol III of the Convention on Certain Conventional Weapons, white phosphorus can be used, but only against enemy combatants and not civilians.  The Independent later reported that there remain widespread reports of civilians suffering extensive burn injuries. commanders insist they always strive to avoid civilian casualties, the story of the battle of Fallujah highlights the intrinsic difficulty of such an endeavour.\\n\\nWhen the Iraqi Governing Council protested against the U.S. assault to retake Fallujah, the U.S. military halted its efforts. In the April battle for Fallujah, Coalition troops killed about 600 insurgents and a number of civilians, while 40 Americans died and hundreds were wounded in a fierce battle. The Marines were ordered to stand-down and cordon off the city, maintaining a perimeter around Fallujah. A compromise was reached in order to ensure security within Fallujah itself by creating the local Fallujah Brigade. While the Marines attacking had a clear advantage in ground firepower and air support, LtGen Conway decided to accept a truce and a deal which put a former Ba\\\\athist general in complete charge of the town's security. The Fallujah Brigade's responsibility was to secure Fallujah and put a stop to insurgent mortar attacks on the nearby U.S. Marine bases. This compromise soon fell apart and insurgent attacks returned, causing Marine commanders to begin preparations for a second attack in the coming fall. By the end of the spring uprising, the cities of Fallujah, Samarra, Baquba, and Ramadi had been left under guerrilla control with coalition patrols in the cities at a minimum.[citation needed].\\n\\nMeanwhile, the fighting continued in the Shiite south, and Italian and Polish forces were having increasing difficulties retaining control over Nasiriya and Najaf. United States Marines were then shifted there to put down the overt rebellion and proceeded to rout Muqtada al-Sadr's Shiite militia. In all, April, May and early June saw more fighting. Over the next three months, the multinational forces took back the southern cities. Also, various insurgent leaders entered into negotiations with the provisional government to lay down arms and enter the political process.\\n\\nOn June 28, 2004, the Coalition Provisional Authority transferred the sovereignty of Iraq to a caretaker government, whose first act was to begin the trial of Saddam Hussein. However, fighting continued in the form of the Iraqi insurgency.  The new government began the process of moving towards open elections, though the insurgency and the lack of cohesion within the government itself, had led to delays. Militia leader Muqtada al-Sadr took control of Najaf and, after negotiations broke down, the government asked the United States for help dislodging him.\\n\\nThrough the months of July and August, a series of skirmishes in and around Najaf culminated with the Imam Ali Mosque itself under siege, only to have a peace deal brokered by Grand Ayatollah Sistani in late August..\\n\\nThe First Battle of Fallujah in April 2004 created an area of extreme instability and a de facto insurgent safe zone.  After several months of this situation, in November 2004 coalition forces attacked and successfully captured Fallujah in the Second Battle of Fallujah.  This battle resulted in the reputed death of over 5,000 insurgent fighters. Marines (the main coalition force in combat) also took substantial casualties with 95 dead and around 500 wounded in action.  According to local sources, hundreds of civilians were also killed and much of the city was destroyed in the battle.\",\n","  \"On January 31, an election for a government to draft a permanent constitution took place. Although some violence and lack of widespread Sunni Arab participation marred the event, most of the eligible Kurd and Shia populace participated. On February 4, Paul Wolfowitz announced that 15,000 U.S. troops whose tours of duty had been extended in order to provide election security would be pulled out of Iraq by the next month. February, March and April proved to be relatively peaceful months compared to the carnage of November and January, with insurgent attacks averaging 30 a day from the prior average of 70..\\n\\nHopes for a quick end to an insurgency and a withdrawal of U.S. troops were dashed at the advent of May, Iraq's bloodiest month since the invasion by U.S. forces in March and April of 2003.  Suicide bombers, believed to be mainly disheartened Iraqi Sunni Arabs, Syrians and Saudis, tore through Iraq. Their targets were often Shia gatherings or civilian concentrations mainly of Shias. As a result, over 700 Iraqi civilians died in that month, as well as 79 U.S.\\n\\nDuring early and mid-May, the U.S. also launched Operation Matador, an assault by around 1,000 Marines in the ungoverned region of western Iraq.  Its goal was the closing of suspected insurgent supply routes of volunteers and material from Syria, and with the fight they received their assumption proved correct.  Fighters armed with flak jackets (unseen in the insurgency before this time) and using sophisticated tactics met the Marines, eventually inflicting 31 U.S. casualties by the operation's end, and suffering 125 casualties themselves.  The Marines were unable to recapture the region due to their limited numbers and the continual insurgent IED attacks and ambushes. The operation continued all the way to the Syrian border, where they were forced to stop (Syrian residents living near the border heard the American bombs very clearly during the operation).  The vast majority of these armed and trained insurgents quickly dispersed before the U.S. could bring the full force of its firepower on them, as it did in Fallujah..\\n\\nOn August 14, 2005 the Washington Post  quoted one anonymous U.S. senior official expressing that the United States no longer expects to see a model new democracy, a self-supporting oil industry or a society in which the majority of people are free from serious security or economic challenges... What we expected to achieve was never realistic given the timetable or what unfolded on the ground\\\\. On September 22, 2005, Prince Saud al-Faisal, the Saudi foreign minister, said that he had warned the Bush administration in recent days that Iraq was hurtling toward disintegration, and that the election planned for December was unlikely to make any difference.  U. officials immediately made statements rejecting this belief ..\\n\\nFollowing the ratification of the Constitution of Iraq on October 15 2005, a general election was held on 15 December to elect a permanent 275-member Iraqi National Assembly..\\n\\nThe beginning of 2006 was marked by government creation talks, growing sectarian violence, and continuous anti-coalition attacks. The United Nations has recently described the environment in Iraq as a civil war-like situation. A 2006 study by the Johns Hopkins Bloomberg School of Public Health has estimated that more than 601,000 Iraqis have died in  violence since the U.S. invasion and that fewer than one third of these deaths came at the hands of Coalition forces. The Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees and the Iraqi government estimate that more than 365,000 Iraqis have been displaced since the bombing of the al-Askari Mosque, bringing the total number of Iraqi refugees to more than 1.6 million..\\n\\nOn February 22 2006, at 6:55 a.m. local time (0355 UTC) two bombs were set off by five to seven men dressed as personnel of the Iraqi Special forces who entered the Al Askari Mosque during the morning. Explosions occurred at the mosque, effectively destroying its golden dome and severely damaging the mosque. Several men, one wearing a military uniform, had earlier entered the mosque, tied up the guards there and set explosives, resulting in the blast..\\n\\nShiites across Iraq expressed their anger by destroying Sunni mosques and killing dozens. Religious leaders of both sides called for calm amid fears this could erupt into a long-feared Sunni-Shia civil war in Iraq..\\n\\nOn March 2 the director of the Baghdad morgue fled Iraq explaining,.\\n\\n7,000 people have been killed by death squads in recent months.  The Boston Globe reported that around eight times the number of Iraqis killed by terrorist bombings during March 2006 were killed by sectarian death squads during the same period. A total of 1,313 were killed by sectarian militias while 173 were killed by suicide bombings. The LA Times later reported that about 3,800 Iraqis were killed by sectarian violence in Baghdad alone during the first three months of 2006. During April 2006, morgue numbers showed that 1,091 Baghdad residents were killed by sectarian executions.\",\n","  \"Insurgencies, frequent terrorist attacks and sectarian violence led to harsh criticism of U.S. Iraq policy and fears of a failing state and civil war. The concerns were expressed by several U.S. think tanks .\\n\\n.\\n\\n as well as the U.S. ambassador to Iraq, Zalmay Khalilzad.\\n\\nIn early 2006, a handful of high-ranking retired generals began to demand United States Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld's resignation due in part to the aforementioned chaos that resulted from his management of the war..\\n\\nThe current government of Iraq took office on May 20, 2006 following approval by the  members of the Iraqi National Assembly. This followed the general election in December 2005. The government succeeded the Iraqi Transitional Government which had continued in office in a caretaker capacity until the new government was agreed..\\n\\nIn September 2006, The Washington Post reported that the commander of the Marine forces in Iraq filed an unusual secret report concluding that the prospects for securing the Anbar province are dim, and that there is almost nothing the U.S. military can do to improve the political and social situation there.\\n\\nIraq was listed fourth on the 2006 Failed States Index compiled by the American Foreign Policy magazine and the Fund for Peace think-tank.  The list was topped by Sudan.\\n\\nAs of October 20 the U.S military announced that operation Together Forward had failed to stem the tide of violence in Baghdad, and Shiite Militants Under al-Sadr seized several southern Iraq Cities..\\n\\nOn November 8, 2006, Donald Rumsfeld tendered his resignation as United States Secretary of Defense.  President George W. Bush then appointed former CIA chief Robert Gates to replace him..\\n\\nOn November 23, 2006 the deadliest attack since the beginning of the Iraq war occurred.  According to The Associated Press, suspected Sunni-Arab militants used five suicide car bombs and two mortar rounds on the capital's Shiite Sadr City slum to kill at least 215 people and wound 257 on Thursday. Shiite mortar teams quickly retaliated, firing 10 shells at Sunni Islam's most important shrine in Baghdad, badly damaging the Abu Hanifa mosque and killing one person. Eight more rounds slammed down near the offices of the Association of Muslim Scholars, the top Sunni Muslim organization in Iraq, setting nearby houses on fire. Two other mortar barrages on Sunni neighborhoods in west Baghdad killed nine and wounded 21, police said late Thursday.\",\n","  \"A bipartisan report by the Iraq Study Group was released on December 6th, 2006. The group was led by former secretary of state James Baker and former Democratic congressman Lee Hamilton, and concludes that the situation in Iraq is grave and deteriorating and U.S. forces seem to be caught in a mission that has no foreseeable end. The report's 79 recommendations include increasing diplomatic measures with Iran and Syria and intensifying efforts to train Iraqi troops. On December 18th, a Pentagon report finds that attacks on Americans and Iraqis average about 960 a week, the highest since the reports began in 2005.\\n\\nCoalition forces formally transferred control of a province to the Iraqi government. The shift is the first of its kind since the war began. Military prosecutors charged 8 Marines with the deaths of 24 Iraqi civilians in Haditha that allegedly occured in November 2005. Ten of the casualties were reported to be women and children. Four officers were also charged with dereliction of duty in relation to the event. Saddam Hussein, captured in December 2003, was hanged on December 30th, 2006 after being found guilty of crimes against humanity.  President Bush works to find a new way forward for the new year, following the prior month's resignation of Donald Rumsfeld. Some speculate that a shift in American policy in Iraq is forthcoming..\\n\\n(Note: This section is used to track various developing events incrementally, by citing materials around the web.

These were reported by various news sources to have broken down, though there were no official statements.\\n\\nIn December 2006, in an unusual sign of progress, officials of various Shiite parties formed a coalition favoring reconciliation, and met with Ayatollah Al-Sistani, spiritual head of Iraq's Shiite community, to seek his approval for this effort.\\n\\nMoqtada Al-Sadr, a leader of a Shiite group, did not initially join this coalition, but did consider participating.  Sadr eventually decided to join the coalition.  This opened the possibility that Sadr's group would return to the Iraqi government, a seeming setback for US interests. However, officials of the Shiite coalition asserted that their goal was to assert reconciliation, stability and the rule of law, and that private armies would not be continued once the Shiite coalition produced some stability.\\n\\nOn December 20, US forces turned over control and responsibility for the Najaf Province, in Southern Iraq, to Iraqi police and military forces.  In Basra, a planned handover was delayed due to security concerns. However, efforts continued to rebuild local Iraqis\\\\ ability to protect themselves. Local sheiks played a leading role in this effort, and relied on the help of the British, whom they termed Abu Naji (the father of salvation).\\n\\nOn December 22, British troops in Basra staged a raid, and seized Iraqi police who were accused of attacking other police officers.\\n\\nIn December 2006, some Sunni tribal leaders stated that they were fighting Al-Qaeda insurgents. Other tribal leaders, however, considered insurgents to be legitimate resistance fighters.\\n\\nTemplate:Iraq War Coalition troop deployment\",\n","  \"The United Nations has also deployed a small contingent to Iraq..\\n\\nUnited Nations Assistance Mission in Iraq (UNAMI).\\n\\n Georgia: 550 blue-helmets.\\n\\n Fiji: 168 blue-helmets.\\n\\n Romania: 130 blue-helmets.\\n\\n Denmark: 35 blue-helmets.\\n\\nWhen the ruling Ba\\\\ath party organization disintegrated after the fall of the Iraqi government, elements of the secret police and Republican Guard formed guerrilla units, since some had simply gone home rather than openly fight the multinational forces.  Many of these smaller units formed the center of the initial anti-coalition insurgency, based primarily around the cities of Mosul, Tikrit and Fallujah. These guerrilla units were the precursor to the eventual formation of what came to be known as the Iraqi insurgency, or those Iraqis and foreigners who attacked coalition or government forces..\\n\\nMore recently in late 2005 and 2006, due to increasing sectarian violence based on either tribal/ethnic distinctions or simply due to increased criminal violence, there has been the formation of various militias. Many of these militias have been formed in response to violent acts committed on the basis of the Shia/Sunni distinction, with whole neighborhoods and cities sometimes being protected or attacked by ethnic or neighborhood militias.[citation needed].\\n\\nThe insurgents and guerrilla units favored attacking unarmored vehicles and avoiding major battles. The early Iraqi insurgency was concentrated in, but not limited to, an area referred to by the Western media and the occupying forces as the Sunni triangle which includes Baghdad. The insurgents dead are numbered between 45-60,000.\\n\\nBy the fall of 2003, these insurgent groups began using typical guerrilla tactics such as ambushes, bombings, kidnappings, and improvised explosive devices.  Other tactics included mortars, suicide bombers, roadside bombs, small arms fire, and RPGs, as well as sabotage against the oil, water, and electrical infrastructure. Multi-national Force-Iraq statistics (see detailed BBC graphic) show that the insurgents primarily targeted coalition forces, Iraqi security forces and infrastructure, and lastly civilians and government officials.  The civilian death log reveals that a large majority of the deaths were by car bombs, booby traps, throat slitting, beheading and other techniques that are known to be associated with insurgents.[citation needed]  These irregular forces favored attacking unarmored or lightly armored Humvee vehicles, the U.S. military's primary transport vehicle.  In November 2003, some of these forces successfully attacked U.S. rotary aircraft with SAM-7 missiles bought on the global black market.[citation needed] Insurgent groups such as the al-Abud Network have even attempted to constitute their own chemical weapons programs, attempting to weaponize traditional mortar rounds with ricin and mustard toxin\",\n","  \"There is evidence that some guerrilla groups are organized, perhaps by the fedayeen and other Saddam Hussein or Ba\\\\ath loyalists, religious radicals, Iraqis angered by the occupation, and foreign fighters.  On February 23, 2005 Al-Iraqiya TV (Iraq) aired transcripts of confessions by Syrian intelligence officer Anas Ahmad Al-Issa and Iraqi insurgent Shihab Al-Sab\\\\awi concerning their booby-trap operations, explosions, kidnappings, assassinations, and details of beheading training in Syria.  The insurgents are known by the Coalition military (especially in the United States armed forces) as Anti-Iraqi Forces (AIF).\\n\\nOne insurgent, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi, was killed on June 7 2006 in the town of Baquba, north of Baghdad, when U.S. warplanes dropped two 500-pound bombs on his isolated safe house.  Zarqawi, a Jordanian, did not fit the usual profile of an Iraqi insurgent and had closer ties to the al Qaeda terrorist organization. Still, President George W. Bush said the killing was a severe blow to al-Qaida and it is a significant victory in the war on terror but cautioned: We have tough days ahead of us in Iraq that will require the continuing patience of the American people..\\n\\nDespite Zarqawi's death Al-Qaeda in Iraq vowed to continue its holy war, according to a statement posted on a Web site announcing: We want to give you the joyous news of the martyrdom of the mujahed sheik Abu Musab al-Zarqawi. Zarqawi's death may have had little impact on the violence since evidence of continued violence in Iraq could still be seen in the month of June with over 1,600 Iraqi deaths that month, the highest monthly total to date since the Al Askari Mosque bombing.\\n\\nIn addition to internal strife, Iran may be playing a role in the insurgency. Michael Barbero said, Iran is definitely a destabilizing force in Iraq, Barbero said. I think it's irrefutable that Iran is responsible for training, funding and equipping some of these Shia extremist groups.[citation needed].\\n\\nThe insurgent tactic that is responsible for the most U.S. deaths and injuries is the.\\n\\nroadside IED. military has taken measures to counter the IEDs, including.\\n\\narmoring humvees (mostly on the bottom, where roadside bombs usually hit).\\n\\nand using radio frequency jammers (so as to prevent bomb detonation). The insurgents.\\n\\nhave adapted to those tactics by using larger explosives, shaped charges,.\\n\\nalternative detonation methods (including electrical wires, mechanical strings, trip wires, and infrared beams),\",\n","  \"and placing bombs on telephone poles and the underside of bridges (so as to attack the top and.\\n\\nsides of vehicles rather than the highly-armored bottom)..\\n\\nTwo of the most powerful current militias are the Mahdi Army and the Badr Organization, with both militias having substantial political support as well in the current Iraqi government. Initially, both organizations were involved in the Iraqi insurgency, most clearly seen with the Mahdi Army at the Battle of Najaf. However in recent months, there has been a split between the two groups..\\n\\nThis violent break between Muqtada al-Sadr's Mahdi Army and the rival Badr Organization of Abdul Aziz al-Hakim, was seen in the fighting in the town of Amarah on October 20, 2006, would severely complicate the efforts of Iraqi and American officials to quell the soaring violence in Iraq.\\n\\nThe war in Iraq was originally justified as part of the U.S.-led War on Terrorism.  Specifically, the Bush Administration argued that Saddam Hussein had ties to al-Qaeda, and that his overthrow would lead to democratization in the Middle East, decreasing terrorism overall.  The alleged ties between Saddam and al-Qaeda were never confirmed, however, and numerous reports of intelligence agencies investigating the matter -- including several reports of the CIA, the U.S. State Department, the FBI, and the Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, as well as the investigations of foreign intelligence agencies -- concluded that no evidence had been found supporting an operational connection between Saddam and al-Qaeda.  The New York Times commented in September 2006 on the conclusions of the bipartisan Senate Select Committee on Intelligence, there is no evidence that Saddam Hussein had prewar ties to Al Qaeda and one of the terror organization’s most notorious members, Abu Musab al-Zarqawi..\\n\\nHowever, al-Qaeda leaders have seen the Iraq war as a boon to their recruiting and operational efforts, providing both evidence to jihadists worldwide that America is at war with Islam, and the training ground for a new generation of jihadists to practice attacks on American forces.  In October 2003, Osama bin Laden announced: Be glad of the good news: America is mired in the swamps of the Tigris and Euphrates. Bush is, through Iraq and its oil, easy prey. Here is he now, thank God, in an embarrassing situation and here is America today being ruined before the eyes of the whole world.  Al-Qaeda commander Seif al-Adl gloated about the war in Iraq, indicating, The Americans took the bait and fell into our trap.  A letter thought to be from al-Qaeda leader Atiyah Abd al-Rahman found in Iraq among the rubble where al-Zarqawi was killed and released by the U.S. military in October 2006, indicated that al-Qaeda perceived the war as beneficial to its goals: The most important thing is that the jihad continues with steadfastness ... indeed, prolonging the war is in our interest..\\n\\nIn the years since the war began, a consensus has developed among intelligence experts that the Iraq war has increased terrorism. Counterterrorism expert Rohan Gunaratna frequently referred to the invasion of Iraq as a fatal mistake that had greatly increased terrorism in the Middle East.  London's conservative International Institute for Strategic Studies concluded in 2004 that the occupation of Iraq had become a potent global recruitment pretext for jihadists and that the invasion galvanized al-Qaeda and perversely inspired insurgent violence there. National Intelligence Council concluded in a January 2005 report that the war in Iraq had become a breeding ground for a new generation of terrorists; David B. Low, the national intelligence officer for transnational threats, indicated that the report concluded that the war in Iraq provided terrorists with a training ground, a recruitment ground, the opportunity for enhancing technical skills...  There is even, under the best scenario, over time, the likelihood that some of the jihadists who are not killed there will, in a sense, go home, wherever home is, and will therefore disperse to various other countries.  The Council's Chairman Robert L. Hutchings said, At the moment, Iraq is a magnet for international terrorist activity.  And the 2006 National Intelligence Estimate, which outlined the considered judgment of all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies, held that The Iraq conflict has become the cause celebre\\\\ for jihadists, breeding a deep resentment of US involvement in the Muslim world and cultivating supporters for the global jihadist movement..\\n\\nSee Also Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda, Saddam Hussein and al-Qaeda timeline, Atta in Prague.\\n\\nSee the above main articles for much more info, and for casualty numbers for coalition nations, contractors, non-Iraqi civilians, journalists, media helpers, aid workers, wounded, etc.. Casualty figures, especially Iraqi ones, are highly disputed.  This section gives a brief overview. There are now at least 8 independent estimates of the number or rate of deaths induced by the invasion of Iraq.\\n\\nThe icasualties.org  website reports the death toll since the invasion in March 2003 as being 3,005 American lives (as of January 2, 2007). There have been a further 250 deaths among the troops of other coalition nations: Australia 2. Bulgaria 13. Denmark 6. El Salvador 5. Estonia 2. Hungary 1. Italy 33. Kazakhstan 1. Latvia 3. Netherlands 2. Poland 18. Romania 2. Slovakia 4. Spain 11. Thailand 2. Ukraine 18. United Kingdom 127\",\n","  'Estimates of Iraqi deaths are highly disputed. In December 2005 President Bush said there were 30,000 Iraqi dead as a guess. CNN wrote: White House spokesman Scott McClellan later said Bush was basing his statement on media reports, not an official government estimate.\\\\   U.S. General Tommy Franks reportedly estimated soon after the invasion that there had been 30,000 Iraqi casualties as of April 9, 2003. After that he made no estimate of death tolls in Iraq. In March 2002 in Afghanistan at a news conference at Bagram Air Base, General Tommy Franks had famously said, we don\\\\t do body counts.\\n\\nFor 2006, a January 2, 2007 Associated Press article reports: The tabulation by the Iraqi ministries of Health, Defence and Interior, showed that 14,298 civilians, 1,348 police and 627 soldiers had been killed in the violence that raged across the country last year. The Associated Press figure, gleaned from daily news reports from Baghdad, arrived at a total of 13,738 deaths.  The Australian reports in a January 2, 2007 article: A figure of 3700 civilian deaths in October [2006], the latest tally given by the UN based on data from the Health Ministry and the Baghdad morgue, was branded exaggerated by the Iraqi Government.  Iraqi government estimates include people killed in bombings and shootings but not deaths classed as criminal\\\\. Also, they include no deaths among the many civilians wounded in attacks who may die later from wounds. Nor do they include many people kidnapped whose fate remains unknown.\\n\\nIn comparison, the Iraq Body Count project states for the week ending Dec. 31, 2006 : It was a truly violent year, as around 24,000 civilians lost their lives in Iraq. This was a massive rise in violence: 14,000 had been killed in 2005, 10,500 in 2004 and just under 12,000 in 2003 (7,000 of them killed during the actual war, while only 5,000 killed during the ‘peace’ that followed in May 2003). In December 2006 alone around 2,800 civilians were reported killed. This week there were over 560 civilian deaths reported..\\n\\nIn its Quick-FAQ  the IBC states: It is likely that many if not most civilian casualties will go unreported by the media. That is the sad nature of war. The IBC counts only those deaths reported by English-language media, and since the invasion began has counted around 50,000 civilian deaths attributable to insurgent or military action in Iraq, and also to increased criminal violence above the level before the invasion. For many examples of undercounting of deaths in Iraq by the media, hospitals, morgues, government agencies, coalition military, etc. see the Undercounting section of Casualties of the conflict in Iraq since 2003..\\n\\nAn independent method for estimating the number of Iraq dead is by using national surveys of mortality. A study in The Lancet estimates 654,965 Iraqi deaths (with a range of 392,979 to 942,636) from March 2003 to July 2006, using this methodology  . That total number of deaths (civilian and non-civilian) includes all excess deaths due to increased lawlessness, degraded infrastructure, poor healthcare, etc, and includes civilians, military deaths and insurgent deaths. This result was disputed by Bush based both on the number of deaths and the methodology .\\n\\nThe various casualty estimates are not necessarily conflicting. The Lancet study states: Aside from Bosnia, we can find no conflict situation where passive surveillance [used by the IBC] recorded more than 20% of the deaths measured by population-based methods [used in the Lancet studies]. In several outbreaks, disease and death recorded by facility-based methods underestimated events by a factor of ten or more when compared with population-based estimates. Between 1960 and 1990, newspaper accounts of political deaths in Guatemala correctly reported over 50% of deaths in years of low violence but less than 5% in years of highest violence.\\n\\nIn December 2006, the report of the Iraq Study Group (ISG) found that the United States has filtered out reports of violence in order to disguise its policy failings in Iraq . The ISG found that U.S. officials reported 93 attacks or significant acts of violence on one day in July 2006, yet a careful review of the reports for that single day brought to light more than 1,100 acts of violence..\\n\\nA November 11, 2006 Los Angeles Times article reports: .\\n\\nAs of November 4, 2006, the U.N.

The Congressional Research Service recently estimated weekly spending at almost $2 billion per week, and that total expenditures have now topped half a trillion dollars. Additionally, the extended combat and equipment loss have placed a severe financial strain on the U.S Army, causing the elimination of non-essential expenses such as travel and civilian hiring.\\n\\nData from the Office of Management and Budget shows that the discretionary defense spending is 20% of government outlays, and the CIA World Factbook lists a 2005 estimate of U.S. military expenditure as 4.06% of GDP (the 26th position in a listing of 167 countries). Other figures, however, show that the total defense expenditures (Department of Defense, Homeland Security and War on Terror) amount to $563 billion, which represents 56% of the nation's discretionary budget  and 47% of the world military spending.\",\n","  \"As of March 2006, approximately £4.5 billion had been spent by the United Kingdom in Iraq.

Supporters of withdrawal argue that the Iraq war is unwinnable, has no purpose, has parallels with the Vietnam war,   has a huge financial cost, as well as the loss of innocent human life, and will be ended by a withdrawal of troops..\\n\\nAnother consideration is the destabilization to the Middle East region that may occur as a consequence of the sudden departure of the United States military.[citation needed] Given the strained relations between the United States and Iraq's neighbor, Iran, and considering the powerful influence of Iran among Iraq's Shi\\\\a Muslim community, some people[who?] fear that Iraq is going to convert into a fundamentalist-lead client state of Iran. The civil strife between the Sunni and Shi\\\\a communities, as well as Kurdish hopes of establishing an independent state of Kurdistan in northern Iraq, could lead to a full-scale civil war.[citation needed]\",\n","  'military strategy in Iraq has drawn criticism from a number of different circles.  Military historian Martin van Creveld, a professor at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem, has called the Iraq war the most foolish war since Emperor Augustus in 9 BC sent his legions into Germany and lost them..\\n\\nThere is also a large amount of criticism from people that support the war but criticize the current military strategy, believing that the current strategy causes unnecessary deaths and injuries of coalition and Iraqi troops, as well as civilian contractors, and does not adequately meet the insurgent threat.[citation needed].\\n\\nIncluded within this is the criticism that, if the military strategy were much more effective,.\\n\\nthen there would be much more support for the war among the people of the coalition countries,.\\n\\nespecially the United States.[citation needed] In a classified memo to the current administration, former Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld recently revealed that he believed the current stategy in Iraq was not working and was in need of change..\\n\\nMany specific strategic criticisms have been made by various individuals and publications..\\n\\nSome major criticisms include:.\\n\\nPrisoners in Iraq detained by U.S. troops are treated badly, and it is estimated that about 1/4th of them are innocent, and many prisoners are subsequently released. The bad treatment of those prisoners angers the civilian population and turns them against the United States. These critics say that prisoners should be treated humanely. (this criticism was made on Nightline , among other places).\\n\\nThere is a very large number of explosion-induced injuries to soldiers\\\\ arms, legs, and faces, including many losses of limbs. Such injuries could be greatly reduced if the soldiers wore light-weight, ventilated, heat-resistant polymer (such as aramid) over their arms and legs, and transparent polycarbonate face masks, which not strong enough to stop a bullet, can prevent much of the damage from the hot particles of explosives.[citation needed] This also applies to the Iraqi police, who are severely under-equipped , and who suffer far more deaths and injuries than coalition troops , and are the permanent stabilizing force that, if strong enough, may allow the coalition troops to withdraw.\\n\\nMost injuries and deaths to coalition troops and Iraqi police are due to covertly-placed roadside bombs (often called  IEDs (improvised explosive devices)) and car bombs. The casualties of coalition troops and Iraqi police depend on the fact that such troops are clearly marked by their uniforms. That not only provides the insurgents with targets, but it also shows them who to avoid when conducting covert activities such as bomb placement. If the coalition troops and Iraqi police used more covert tactics, including the use of plain-clothes Iraqi police posing as militia men (it would not work for coalition members, due to the conspicuousness of both their race and their language), the use of hidden cameras with nightvision capability, and constant aerial surveillance of roads (such as by predator drones), then coalition and Iraqi forces would be able to prevent insurgents planting bombs. It is only by watching such insurgents when they think that they are not being watched, that they can be seen and killed. Covert surveillance and plainclothes Iraqi troops in a perimeter around overt coalition and Iraqi troop positions would also be effective in sniper attacks and gun battles.',\n","  'Template:TotallyDisputed-section.\\n\\nConcerns have been raised of insufficiently critical coverage of the activities of U.S. forces in Iraq.

At the same time, many believe that U.S. forces have come under little U.S. media scrutiny.[citation needed] Even in the most extreme cases, such as the Haditha massacre, U.S. media coverage has been considerably less than in European countries such as the United Kingdom.[citation needed].\\n\\nThe killing of Nicola Calipari by an American soldier, which Italian prosecutors are now classifying as murder, received U.S. media coverage because the victim was an Italian Major-General. This incident fits a pattern, suggested by most of the mainstream European media (especially in the British Guardian newspaper and the French Le Monde newspaper), of widespread unprovoked fatal incidents.[citation needed] Another cited example is the killing of British reporter Terry Lloyd, who was found by the coroner to have been unlawfully killed by U.S. marines in Iraq . The Independent on Sunday (15 October 2006) suggested that this death was the result of U.S. soldiers\\\\ hostility to his decision to report independently rather than being embedded with coalition forces..\\n\\nOfficials in the Bush Administration have claimed that the media overemphasizes negative stories and does not report the positive developments in Iraq with the same vigor.[verification needed]  Both The New York Times and The Wall Street Journal published more than double as many negative headlines as positive on the Iraq War between May 2003 and May 2006, while NBC News and ABC News televised an even higher proportion of negative headlines in the same period.  Fox News, however, had a higher proportion of neutral headlines than its competitors..\\n\\nCritics have long questioned the reliance of the major media outlets on Iraqi stringers with suspected ties to insurgent groups and terrorists as a source of information -- discounting the versions of events as explained by the coalition and the Iraqi government.[who?]  For example, on November 24, 2006, the AP distributed a story from one of their stringers, sourced by an Iraqi Police officer named Jamil Hussein, of four mosques being burned to the ground along with the deaths of six Sunni worshipers who were doused in kerosene and burnt alive. Despite the source, there has been no confirmation of the story by the coalition.[citation needed]  Currently, the AP stands by this story because they have used Jamil Hussein as a source for over two years.

He was sworn in on 17 July 2003. Bemba also leads the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), a rebel group turned political party. He received the second highest number of votes in the 2006 presidential election. In January 2007 he was elected to the Senate..\\n\\nBemba is one of the richest men in the Congo, with an estimated fortune of several hundred million dollars.  His businesses have included portable radios, aviation and private television stations. His father was a businessman who was successful under former Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, and one of his sisters is married to Mobutu's son Nzanga, who was also a candidate in the 2006 presidential elections..\\n\\nIn 2002, President Ange-Félix Patassé of the Central African Republic invited the MLC to come to his country and put down a coup attempt; human rights activists have accused MLC fighters of committing atrocities against hundreds of suspected rebel sympathizers in the course of this conflict. In March 2003, Patassé was ousted, and the government that replaced him pressed charges against Patassé and Bemba in September 2004. International arrest warrants were issued, but because the new government was unable to have him arrested, the matter was referred to the International Criminal Court, whose Prosecutor has yet to decide whether an investigation needs to be opened.\\n\\nBemba was one of 33 candidates who ran in the Congolese presidential election on 30 July, 2006. His main campaign slogan — One Hundred Percent Congolese — was widely perceived as an attack on frontrunner President Joseph Kabila.\\n\\nDuring the campaign, he denied allegations of cannibalism, after opponents claimed that he had eaten pygmies during fighting in 2002. These are lies which have come from the highest levels of government...The pygmies are alive and well he responded.\\n\\nBemba received substantial support in the western, Lingala-speaking portion of the country, including the capital, Kinshasa. Following the vote there was significant tension as to whether the results would give Kabila a majority of the vote, in which case there would not be a second round against Bemba, who was perceived as Kabila's main opponent. However, according to results announced on 20 August, Kabila won 44% of the vote and Bemba won 20%, and therefore the two faced each other in a second round, held on October 29. The electoral commission announced the official results on November 15, naming Kabila the winner with 58.05% of the vote; Bemba's supporters have alleged fraud..\\n\\nOn November 27, 2006, the Supreme Court of the DRC rejected the fraud charges brought by the Jean Pierre Bemba, and confirmed Kabila as the new elected Congolese President. A day later, Bemba said that he disagreed with the court's decision, but that in the greater national interest and to preserve peace and to save the country from chaos and violence, he would participate in the system by leading the opposition. He did not attend Kabila's swearing-in ceremony on December 6. On December 8, the MLC announced that Bemba would run for a Senate seat from Kinshasa in the January 2007 senatorial election, and he succeeded in winning a seat..\\n\\nTemplate:Persondata.\\n\\nBemba seeks refuge with the South African embassy.\"],\n"," [\"A political crisis began in Zimbabwe on 11 March 2007 when opposition leader Morgan Tsvangirai was beaten and tortured after being arrested, prompting widespread domestic and international criticism..\\n\\n14 March: Two female officers were seriously injured in a fire-bomb attack on a police station in Harare; the government blamed the opposition Movement for Democratic Change (MDC).

It was elected as the location for the G8 summit due to its isolated location, in anticipation of protests such as those in Gleneagles and St Petersburg. The summit site has already been fenced off by  12 km long barrier, costing an approximate EUR 12.4 million.',\n","  \"Heiligendamm, known as White Town by the Sea, also used to be the summer getaway of the Russian imperial family, who also were related to the Dukes of Mecklenburg. For the occasion of the G8 summit, a former summer residence of the imperial family was demolished to make space for a media centre..\\n\\nAt the end of the 32nd G8 summit in Russia, German Chancellor Angela Merkel reported that the agenda of the G8 summit in 2007 had not been determined, but the struggle against poverty across the globe will be a priority.\\n\\nAccording to the official German Presidency website, the summit's motto will be Growth and Responsibility, focusing on Investition, Innovation und Nachhaltigkeit (Investment, Innovation and Sustainability), and Africa: good governance, sustainable investment, peace and security. Transparency of the financial markets, intellectual property and energy efficiency will also be on the agenda, as well as talks about climate change..\\n\\nOn April 13, 2007, Oil Change International released a reported leaked draft of the economic communique.  The G8 financial ministers began pre-summit meetings on 30 May 2007..\\n\\nThis will be the first G8 summit for Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and French President Nicolas Sarkozy, and the final one for British Prime Minister Tony Blair - as well as for Russian President Vladimir Putin..\\n\\nOn December 29, 2006, anonymous protesters splattered the Kempinski hotel with red and black paintbombs; the combination of red and black is a common symbol of the anarchist movement for flags, banners, stickers etc..\\n\\nFor the 33rd G8 summit, the local police are expecting about 100,000 protesters from all parts of Germany and other countries. Preparations are nervous on both sides: 16,000 policemen are deployed to protect the heads of state and government, the 12 kilometers long steel fence has been built around Heiligendamm for the price of 12.4 million Euro, while ATTAC Germany has chartered three trains to get as many discontented citizens as possible from the farther parts of Germany and nearby countries to what is expected to be this year's biggest unified demonstration against G8, along with numerous buses organised by various groups and political parties. The main demonstration, taking place June 2, 2007 in the nearby big city of Rostock, is the starting event for a whole week of protests and blockades. While organisers expected up to 80,000 participants, police put the figure at an estimated 25,000.  Anticipation is high by protesters for a strengthening of the anti-globalisation movement.  As at previous G8 summits, some protests have turned into violent riots. Towards the end of the June 2 protest, violent clashes between protesters and the police, though essentially limited to a small area at the harbour, was initially reported to have injured nearly 1000 people (433 German police officers, 30-33 of them requiring hospitalisation, and 520 protesters, 20 requiring hospitalisation). Later, these figures were disputed, and the number of police requiring hospitalisation was corrected to 2. According to police estimates, 2000 autonomists led the riots, setting fire to a total of 3 cars and setting up make-shift barricades; many peaceful protesters fled the scene in panic . 128 protesters were detained, but arrest warrants were only issued for 10; the other were either set free due to lack of evidence or are pending review of evidence..\\n\\nA protest also occurred on 2 June 2007 on the river bank opposite the Houses of Parliament in London, principally a reminder of the G8's previous (and, as the protestors saw them, unfulfilled) promises on debt relief, entitled G8 – The World Can\\\\t Wait and Wake Up To Poverty.  It was a static protest, with small marches converging on in from Lambeth Park and Methodist Central Hall, on a route starting at the foot of Victoria Tower, along the riverbank of Victoria Tower Gardens, the north side of Lambeth Bridge, and the southern riverbank opposite Parliament as far as (but not including) Westminster Bridge.  This principally involved the protesters setting off alarm clocks at 2pm as a wakeup call to the G8, and passed without incident.\\n\\nG8 leaders reach agreement on a deal to reduce greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.\"]]"]},"execution_count":157,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 6.23 ms (started: 2022-05-20 18:29:03 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["output_str[:5]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653071345050,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"57UanzoILwZP","outputId":"8c4889b6-97e1-4930-8e99-e6ac736e2e14"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["str"]},"execution_count":158,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 3.08 ms (started: 2022-05-20 18:29:03 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["type(summ_clusters[0])"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653071345050,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"uVVxnQdhYI2o","outputId":"bcc08257-caf1-481a-8d79-10c02ae391e4"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs3_train/filtered'"]},"execution_count":159,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 2.84 ms (started: 2022-05-20 18:29:04 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["%pwd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":1440,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653071350410,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"oLJjMKHrNeDA","outputId":"8a812fa8-bc4c-4241-ceed-e9050c54853c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 1.23 s (started: 2022-05-20 18:29:08 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["wrap = []\n","src_strs = output_str.copy()\n","\n","for idx in range(len(src_strs)):\n","    idx_content = {}\n","    idx_content['document'] = src_strs[idx]\n","    idx_content['summary'] = summ_clusters[idx].lstrip('{\"').lstrip(\"{'\").rstrip('\\n')\n","    wrap.append(idx_content)\n","torch.save(wrap, 'wceptest_train.pt')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"lsbnmEAJec20"},"outputs":[],"source":["wrap[:5]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1651036113327,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"GDbW3m7CERV4","outputId":"f9eca549-15d5-4e77-fdf9-671682f83416"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs1_valid\n","time: 18.5 ms (started: 2022-04-27 05:08:32 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs1_valid\n","wceptest_check = torch.load('wceptest_checktrainvalid.pt')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"FDa49SpSFCpw"},"outputs":[],"source":["wceptest_check[0]['document']"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":10,"status":"ok","timestamp":1651036128677,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"Ykk77iaZE2bw","outputId":"d0d3cc34-bb39-4573-d3a3-26119cde38ec"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["37674\n","time: 66.3 ms (started: 2022-04-27 05:08:48 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["sents=0\n","for idx in range(len(wceptest_check)):\n","    for id in range(len(wceptest_check[idx]['document'])):\n","        for i in range(len(wceptest_check[idx]['document'][id].split('\\n\\n'))):\n","            par = wceptest_check[idx]['document'][id].split('\\n\\n')[i]\n","            sents+=len(par.split('.
