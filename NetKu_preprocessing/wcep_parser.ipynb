Bureau of Investigation (FBI) announced the arrests of 13 men suspected of orchestrating a domestic terror plot to kidnap Gretchen Whitmer, the Governor of Michigan, and otherwise violently overthrow the state government. The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court..\\\\c\\\\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, flew under the radar, adding, This is simply not a big group that we\\\\d ever heard of..\\\\c\\\\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group\\\\s ideology adhered to..\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she also became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May, including one in which armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. President Donald Trump had offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer that woman from Michigan and tweeting on April 17: LIBERATE MICHIGAN!.\\\\c\\\\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4â3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services â and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration â to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public..\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group\\\\s commander. An NBC News investigation into the suspects\\\\ social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material..\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators..\\\\c\\\\cJoseph M. Morrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words Liberty or Death. Morrison\\\\s neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home\\\\s residents were disrespectful and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was Boogaloo Bunyan. Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges..\\\\c\\\\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother\\\\s maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop\\\\s owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group\\\\s meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer\\\\s handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to rage issues and threatening other members on social media..\\\\c\\\\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor\\\\s vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for night fishing as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record..\\\\c\\\\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country\\\\s current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an uprising. However, he also included Trump\\\\s name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder..\\\\c\\\\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts..\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence. The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot..\\\\c\\\\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer\\\\s implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began liking posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers..\\\\c\\\\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled Gretchen Whitmer Interview, depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico\\\\s attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too soft and wouldn\\\\t commit to violence..\\\\c\\\\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house\\\\s yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013..\\\\c\\\\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month..\\\\c\\\\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer\\\\s COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump\\\\s Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook..\\\\c\\\\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar\\\\s former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a very angry person and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar\\\\s father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder..\\\\c\\\\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s home..\\\\c\\\\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. In March 2020, local officers from an unidentified police department in Michigan reported to the FBI that the militia was seeking addresses of officers. The FBI then interviewed a militia member, who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill police officers. On May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft\\\\s Facebook account. Agents found messages plotting potential acts of violence, including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who may be first and was wanted in custody; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster..\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages, was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen\\\\s arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated a violent intent..\\\\c\\\\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer\\\\s address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. The plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how tyrants should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia â already being investigated by the FBI â seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested 200 men to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a trial for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises..\\\\c\\\\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state\\\\s order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a tyrant bitch and stating to viewers, I don\\\\t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do..\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member\\\\s property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico\\\\s defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan\\\\s tactical viability, saying, It\\\\s a fishbowl. Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Musico\\\\s attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico\\\\s eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI\\\\s confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time..\\\\c\\\\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer\\\\s family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor\\\\s office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\\\\m not even fuckin\\\\ kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\\\\t fuckin\\\\ care anymore, I\\\\m just so sick of it. That\\\\s what it\\\\s gonna take for us to take it back, we\\\\re just gonna have to everything\\\\s gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\\\\re gonna topple it all, dude. It\\\\s what great frickin\\\\ conquerors, man, we\\\\re just gonna conquer every fuckin\\\\ thing man. In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out, with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a widespread bombing campaign, according to the FBI..\\\\c\\\\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor\\\\s Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\\\\ Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it\\\\s over. Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer\\\\s exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions..\\\\c\\\\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor\\\\s residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer\\\\s boat. Harris said in a chat, Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. ... I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself. During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat..\\\\c\\\\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\\\\ home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, We ain\\\\t gonna let \\\\em burn our fuckin\\\\ state down. I don\\\\t give a fuck if there\\\\s only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\\\\ll go out there and use deadly force. The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge near the vacation home to slow and distract police..\\\\c\\\\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor\\\\s Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying perimeter security and other safety upgrades were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer..\\\\c\\\\cWhile driving in three vehiclesâwith an undercover FBI agent and confidential source presentâfrom a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin\\\\s property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely..\\\\c\\\\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin\\\\s property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping. An undercover agent told Fox that explosives for destroying the bridge leading to the lake would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting..\\\\c\\\\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment..\\\\c\\\\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry an automatic sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam\\\\s security staff about the potential threat..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found explosive device components and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and all anti-Americans..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 30, Franks\\\\s attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a violent extremist and saying such a decision would be unreasonable..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors..\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico\\\\s bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial..\\\\c\\\\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client\\\\s plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond..\\\\c\\\\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge..\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters sick and depraved men, and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House. Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump\\\\s rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country..\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot one of the largest cases in recent history and labeled the case as rather unprecedented in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\\\\ original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges disturbing and said, This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police..\\\\c\\\\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of extreme violence and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan\\\\s schools and churches were closed under Whitmer\\\\s orders. In response to Trump\\\\s remarks, Whitmer said it tells you everything you need to know about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump\\\\s remarks on October 16, saying the failure to condemn these folks is stunning..\\\\c\\\\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of Lock her up!, to which he replied, Lock \\\\em all up. Trump\\\\s daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely having fun at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC\\\\s Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump\\\\s rhetoric incredibly disturbing and said it is inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism. She also countered Trump\\\\s claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\\\\t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of Lock her up!..\\\\c\\\\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response..\\\\c\\\\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it\\\\s a felony, make a felony arrest. Citing the state\\\\s citizen\\\\s arrest statute, he continued, It doesn\\\\t say if you are an elected office that you\\\\re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\\\\m hoping that\\\\s more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\\\\m not even sure if they had any part of it..\\\\c\\\\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as dangerous, while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen\\\\s arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called horrible. His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign..\\\\c\\\\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan\\\\s electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\\\\ offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following credible threats of violence. The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a Hail Mary effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, No. I don\\\\t know. Because what we\\\\re doing today is uncharted. Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17..\\\\c\\\\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer\\\\s kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI\\\\s investigation..\\\\c\\\\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired..\\\\c\\\\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\\\\ actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen\\\\s actions..\\\\c\\\\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as Mostly False.\\n',\n"," 'Brexit (/ËbrÉksÉªt, ËbrÉÉ¡zÉªt/; a portmanteau of British exit) was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) at the end of 31 January 2020 CET. The UK is the first and only country formally to leave the EU, after 47 years of having been a member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Communities (EC), since 1 January 1973. It continued to participate in the European Union Customs Union and European Single Market during a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET)..\\\\c\\\\cThe European Union and its institutions have developed gradually since their establishment, including 47 years of British membership, and grew to be of significant importance to the UK. Throughout that time Eurosceptic groups had existed, opposing aspects of the Union and its predecessors. Prime Minister Harold Wilsonâs pro-Europe government held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975 in which voters chose to stay within the bloc with 67.2% of the vote share, but no further referendums were held as the project grew and became ever-closer in the subsequent Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. Facing pressure from Eurosceptic groups, Prime Minister David Cameron\\\\s pro-Europe government held a second referendum on continued EU membership in 2016 in which voters chose to leave the EU with 51.9% of the vote share. This led to his resignation, replacement by Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and future relations. This process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, with one deal rejected by the British parliament, general elections held in 2017 and 2019, and two new Prime Ministers in that time, both Conservative. Under Boris Johnson\\\\s government, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 CET; trade deal negotiations continued to within days of the scheduled end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 CET..\\\\c\\\\cThe effects of Brexit will in part be determined by the EUâUK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was agreed on 24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK Parliament on 30 December 2020 and was provisionally applied by the EU from 31 December 2020. The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK\\\\s economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for British higher education, academic research and security; the Turing scheme was announced as a new global student exchange programme in early 2021 to combat this. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over British laws or its Supreme Court. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, in which 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48.11% voted to remain a member, Prime Minister David Cameron resigned. On 29 March 2017, the new British Government led by Theresa May formally notified the EU of the country\\\\s intention to withdraw, beginning the Brexit process. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for 29 March 2019. It was delayed by deadlock in the British Parliament after the June 2017 general election, which resulted in a hung parliament in which the Conservatives lost their majority but remained the largest party. This deadlock led to three extensions of the Article 50 process..\\\\c\\\\cThe deadlock was resolved after a subsequent general election was held in December 2019. In that election, Conservatives who campaigned in support of a revised withdrawal agreement led by Boris Johnson won an overall majority of 80 seats. After the December 2019 election, the British Parliament finally ratified the withdrawal agreement. The UK left the EU at the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11 p.m. GMT). This began a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 CET (11 p.m. GMT), during which the UK and EU negotiated their future relationship. During the transition, the UK remained subject to EU law and remained part of the EU customs union and single market. However, it was no longer part of the EU\\\\s political bodies or institutions..\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal was advocated by hard Eurosceptics and opposed by pro-Europeanists and soft Eurosceptics, with both sides of the argument spanning the political spectrum. The UK joined the European Communities (EC) â principally the European Economic Community (EEC) â in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in the 1975 referendum. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the Labour Party\\\\s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty founded the EU, was ratified by the British Parliament in 1993 but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party led a rebellion over ratification of the treaty and, with the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the cross-party People\\\\s Pledge campaign then led a collective campaign particularly after the Treaty of Lisbon was also ratified by the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 without being put to a referendum following a previous promise to hold a referendum on ratifying the abandoned European Constitution was never held eventually pressured the Conservative prime minister David Cameron to hold the June 2016 membership referendum. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by Theresa May..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 March 2017, the British government formally began the withdrawal process by invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union with permission from Parliament. May called a snap general election in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government supported by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). UKâEU withdrawal negotiations began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 withdrawal agreement, but the British parliament voted against ratifying it three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement\\\\s financial settlement, as well as the Irish backstop designed to prevent border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a proposed second referendum..\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 March 2019, the British Parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until June, and then later October. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by Boris Johnson. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. On 17 October 2019, the British Government and the EU agreed on a revised withdrawal agreement, with new arrangements for Northern Ireland. Parliament approved the agreement for further scrutiny, but rejected passing it into law before the 31 October deadline, and forced the government (through the Benn Act) to ask for a third Brexit delay. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020. The withdrawal agreement was ratified by the UK on 23 January and by the EU on 30 January; it came into force on 31 January 2020..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the referendum of 23 June 2016, many new pieces of Brexit-related jargon entered popular use..\\\\c\\\\cThe Inner Six European countries signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951, establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The 1955 Messina Conference deemed that the ECSC was a success, and resolved to extend the concept further, thereby leading to the 1957 Treaties of Rome establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). In 1967, these became known as the European Communities (EC). The UK attempted to join in 1963 and 1967, but these applications were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle..\\\\c\\\\cSome time after de Gaulle resigned in 1969, the UK successfully applied for EC membership, and the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972. Parliament passed the European Communities Act later that year and the UK joined Denmark and Ireland in becoming a member on 1 January 1973..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party was the more Eurosceptic of the two major parties, and the Conservatives the more Europhile. The 1983 Labour Party manifesto would even pledge to leave the then European Economic Community. Earlier on, Labour had won the February 1974 general election without a majority and then contested the subsequent October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain\\\\s terms of membership of the EC, believing them to be unfavourable, and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EC on the new terms. Labour again won the election (this time with a small majority), and in 1975 the UK held its first ever national referendum, asking whether the UK should remain in the EC. Despite significant division within the ruling Labour Party, all major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. On 5 June 1975, 67.2% of the electorate and all but two British counties and regions voted to stay in; support for the UK to leave the EC in 1975 appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum..\\\\c\\\\cThe Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EC without a referendum. After their heavy defeat in that election, Labour changed its policy. In 1985, the second Margaret Thatcher government ratified the Single European Actâthe first major revision to the Treaty of Romeâwithout a referendum.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cIn October 1990, under pressure from senior ministers and despite Thatcher\\\\s deep reservations, the UK joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the pound sterling pegged to the deutschmark. Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister the following month, amid Conservative Party divisions arising partly from her increasingly Eurosceptic views. The UK and Italy were forced to withdraw from the ERM in September 1992, after the pound sterling and the lira came under pressure from currency speculation (Black Wednesday)..\\\\c\\\\cUnder the Maastricht Treaty, the EC became the EU on 1 November 1993, reflecting the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political one. Denmark, France, and Ireland held referendums to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. In accordance with Constitution of the United Kingdom, specifically that of parliamentary sovereignty, ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian Vernon Bogdanor wrote that there was a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK\\\\s previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had no way to express it. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimateâwhich requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain\\\\s relationship with the [EC]. This perceived democratic deficit directly led to the formation of the Referendum Party and the UK Independence Party.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cThatcher, who had previously supported the common market and the Single European Act, in the Bruges speech of 1988 warned against a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. She influenced Daniel Hannan, who in 1990 founded the Oxford Campaign for Independent Britain; With hindsight, some see this as the start of the campaign for Brexit, the Financial Times later wrote. In 1994, Sir James Goldsmith formed the Referendum Party to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the nature of the UK\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. The party fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election, and won 810,860 votesâ2.6% of the total votes castâbut failed to win a parliamentary seat because the vote was spread across the country. The Referendum Party disbanded after Goldsmith\\\\s death in 1997.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cThe UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was formed in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than Labour or the Conservatives had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election. UKIP\\\\s electoral success in the 2014 European election is documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum..\\\\c\\\\cUKIP won two by-elections (triggered by defecting Conservative MPs) in 2014; in the 2015 general election, the party took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014..\\\\c\\\\cBoth pro- and anti-EU views had majority support at different times from 1977 to 2015. In the EC membership referendum of 1975, two-thirds of British voters favoured continued EC membership. Over the decades of UK-EU membership, Euroscepticism existed on both the left and right of British politics..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to a statistical analysis published in April 2016 by Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, surveys showed an increase in Euroscepticism (defined as a wish to sever or reduce the powers of the EU) from 38% in 1993 to 65% in 2015. The BSA survey for the period of JulyâNovember 2015 showed that 60% backed the option to continue as a member and 30% backed withdrawal..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron initially rejected calls for a referendum on the UK\\\\s EU membership, but then suggested the possibility of a future referendum to endorse his proposed renegotiation of Britain\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. According to the BBC, The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK\\\\s [renegotiated] position within the [EU] had \\\\the full-hearted support of the British people\\\\ but they needed to show \\\\tactical and strategic patience\\\\. On 23 January 2013, under pressure from many of his MPs and from the rise of UKIP, Cameron promised in his Bloomberg speech that a Conservative government would hold an in-or-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in the 7 May 2015 general election. This was included in the Conservative Party manifesto for the election..\\\\c\\\\cThe Conservative Party won the election with a majority. Soon afterwards, the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Cameron favoured remaining in a reformed EU, and sought to renegotiate on four key points: protection of the single market for non-eurozone countries, reduction of red tape, exempting Britain from ever-closer union, and restricting immigration from the rest of the EU..\\\\c\\\\cIn December 2015, opinion polls showed a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU; they also showed support would drop if Cameron did not negotiate adequate safeguards[definition needed] for non-eurozone member states, and restrictions on benefits for non-UK EU citizens..\\\\c\\\\cThe outcome of the renegotiations was revealed in February 2016. Some limits to in-work benefits for new EU immigrants were agreed, but before they could be applied, a member state such as the UK would have to get permission from the European Commission and then from the European Council, which is composed of the heads of government of every member state..\\\\c\\\\cIn a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016, and commented on the renegotiation settlement. He spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a Leave vote and of the two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the original wording for the referendum question was challenged, the government agreed to change the official referendum question to Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?.\\\\c\\\\cIn the referendum 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU (Leave), and 48.11% voted in favour of remaining a member of the EU (Remain). After this result, Cameron resigned on 13 July 2016, with Theresa May becoming Prime Minister after a leadership contest. A petition calling for a second referendum attracted more than four million signatures, but was rejected by the government on 9 July..\\\\c\\\\cA 2017 study published in Economic Policy showed that the Leave vote tended to be greater in areas which had lower incomes and high unemployment, a strong tradition of manufacturing employment, and in which the population had fewer qualifications. It also tended to be greater where there was a large flow of Eastern European migrants (mainly low-skilled workers) into areas with a large share of native low-skilled workers. Those in lower social grades (especially the working class) were more likely to vote Leave, while those in higher social grades (especially the upper middle class) more likely to vote Remain. Studies found that the Leave vote tended to be higher in areas affected by economic decline, high rates of suicides and drug-related deaths, and austerity reforms introduced in 2010..\\\\c\\\\cStudies suggest that older people were more likely to vote Leave, and younger people more likely to vote Remain. According to Thomas Sampson, an economist at the London School of Economics, Older and less-educated voters were more likely to vote \\\\leave\\\\ [...] A majority of white voters wanted to leave, but only 33% of Asian voters and 27% of black voters chose leave. There was no gender split in the vote [...] Leaving the European Union received support from across the political spectrum [...] Voting to leave the European Union was strongly associated with holding socially conservative political beliefs, opposing cosmopolitanism, and thinking life in Britain is getting worse..\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polls found that Leave voters believed leaving the EU was more likely to bring about a better immigration system, improved border controls, a fairer welfare system, better quality of life, and the ability to control our own laws, while Remain voters believed EU membership would be better for the economy, international investment, and the UK\\\\s influence in the world. Polls found that the main reasons people voted Leave were the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK, and that leaving offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders. The main reason people voted Remain was that the risks of voting to leave the EU looked too great when it came to things like the economy, jobs and prices..\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal from the European Union is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. It was originally drafted by Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, and introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon at the insistence of the United Kingdom.[citation needed] The article states that any member state can withdraw in accordance with its own constitutional requirements by notifying the European Council of its intention to do so. The notification triggers a two-year negotiation period, in which the EU must negotiate and conclude an agreement with [the leaving] State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the [European] Union. If no agreement is reached within the two years, the membership ends without an agreement, unless an extension is unanimously agreed among all EU states, including the withdrawing state. On the EU side, the agreement needs to be ratified by qualified majority in the European Council, and by the European Parliament..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2015 Referendum Act did not expressly require Article 50 to be invoked, but prior to the referendum, the British government said it would respect the result. When Cameron resigned following the referendum, he said that it would be for the incoming prime minister to invoke Article 50. The new prime minister, Theresa May, said she would wait until 2017 to invoke the article, in order to prepare for the negotiations. In October 2016, she said Britain would trigger Article 50 in March 2017, and in December she gained the support of MP\\\\s for her timetable..\\\\c\\\\cIn January 2017, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled in the Miller case that government could only invoke Article 50 if authorised by an act of parliament to do so. The government subsequently introduced a bill for that purpose, and it was passed into law on 16 March as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. On 29 March, Theresa May triggered Article 50 when Tim Barrow, the British ambassador to the EU, delivered the invocation letter to European Council President Donald Tusk. This made 29 March 2019 the expected date that UK would leave EU..\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2017, Theresa May called a snap general election, held on 8 June, in an attempt to strengthen [her] hand in the negotiations; The Conservative Party, Labour and UKIP made manifesto pledges to implement the referendum, the Labour manifesto differing in its approach to Brexit negotiations, such as unilaterally offering permanent residence to EU immigrants. The Liberal Democrat Party and the Green Party manifestos proposed a policy of remaining in the EU via a second referendum. The Scottish National Party (SNP) manifesto proposed a policy of waiting for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and then holding a referendum on Scottish independence..\\\\c\\\\cThe result produced an unexpected hung parliament, the governing Conservatives gained votes (but nevertheless lost seats and their majority in the House of Commons) but remained the largest party. Labour gained significantly on votes and seats, retaining its position as the second-largest party. The Liberal Democrats gained six seats despite a slight decrease in vote share compared with 2015. The Green Party kept its single MP while also losing national vote share. Losing votes and seats were the SNP, which lost 21 MPs, and UKIP, which suffered a -10.8% swing and lost its only MP. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FeÌin also made gains in votes and seats..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 June 2017, Conservatives and the DUP reached a confidence and supply agreement whereby the DUP would back the Conservatives in key votes in the House of Commons over the course of the parliament. The agreement included additional funding of Â£1 billion for Northern Ireland, highlighted mutual support for Brexit and national security, expressed commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and indicated that policies such as the state pension triple lock and Winter Fuel Payments would be maintained..\\\\c\\\\cPrior to the negotiations, May said that the British government would not seek permanent single market membership, would end ECJ jurisdiction, seek a new trade agreement, end free movement of people and maintain the Common Travel Area with Ireland. The EU had adopted its negotiating directives in May, and appointed Michel Barnier as Chief Negotiator. The EU wished to perform the negotiations in two phases:  first the UK would agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, and then negotiations on a future relationship could begin. In the first phase, the member states would demand that the UK pay a divorce bill, initially estimated as amounting to Â£52 billion. EU negotiators said that an agreement must be reached between UK and the EU by October 2018..\\\\c\\\\cNegotiations commenced on 19 June 2017. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa; Britain\\\\s outstanding financial obligations to the EU; and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In December 2017, a partial agreement was reached. It ensured that there would be no hard border in Ireland, protected the rights of UK citizens in EU and EU citizens in Britain, and estimated the financial settlement to be Â£35â39 billion. May stressed that Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Following this partial agreement, EU leaders agreed to move on to the second phase in the negotiations:  discussion of the future relationship, a transition period and a possible trade deal..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2018, a 21-month transition period and the terms for it were provisionally agreed. In June 2018, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that there had been little progress on the Irish border questionâon which the EU proposed a backstop, to come into effect if no overall trade deal had been reached by the end of the transition periodâand that it was unlikely that there would be a solution before October, when the whole deal was to be agreed. In July 2018, the British government published the Chequers plan, its aims for the future relationship to be determined in the negotiations. The plan sought to keep British access to the single market for goods, but not necessarily for services, while allowing for an independent trade policy. The plan caused cabinet resignations, including Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson..\\\\c\\\\cOn 13 November 2018, UK and EU negotiators agreed the text of a draft withdrawal agreement, and May secured her cabinet\\\\s backing of the deal the following day, though Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned over fatal flaws in the agreement. It was expected that ratification in the British parliament would be difficult. On 25 November, all 27 leaders of the remaining EU countries endorsed the agreement..\\\\c\\\\cOn 10 December 2018, the Prime Minister postponed the vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal. This came minutes after the Prime Minister\\\\s Office confirmed the vote would be going ahead. Faced with the prospect of a defeat in the House of Commons, this option gave May more time to negotiate with Conservative backbenchers and the EU, even though they had ruled out further discussions. The decision was met with calls from many Welsh Labour MPs for a motion of no confidence in the Government..\\\\c\\\\cAlso on 10 December 2018, the European Court of Justice(ECJ) ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its notification of withdrawal, as long as it was still a member and had not agreed a withdrawal agreement. The decision to do so should be unequivocal and unconditional and follow a democratic process.If the British revoked their notification, they would remain a member of the EU under their current membership terms. The case was launched by Scottish politicians, and referred to the ECJ by the Scottish Court of Session..\\\\c\\\\cThe European Research Group (ERG), a staunchly anti-EU grouping in Conservative Party, opposed the Prime Minister\\\\s proposed Withdrawal Agreement treaty. Its members objected strongly to the Withdrawal Agreement\\\\s inclusion of the Irish backstop. ERG members also objected to the proposed Â£39 billion financial settlement with the EU and stated that the agreement would result in the UK\\\\s agreement to continuing to follow EU regulations in major policy areas; and to the continuing jurisdiction of the ECJ over interpretation of the agreement and of European law still applicable to the UK..\\\\c\\\\cOn 15 January 2019, the House of Commons voted 432 to 202 against the deal, which was the largest majority ever against a United Kingdom government. Soon after, a motion of no confidence in Her Majesty\\\\s Government was tabled by the opposition, which was rejected by 325 votes to 306..\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 February, Prime Minister May proposed that the next vote on the withdrawal agreement would be on 12 March 2019, 17 days away from the Brexit date. On 12 March, the proposal was defeated by 391 votes to 242âa loss by 149 votes, down from 230 from when the deal had been proposed in January..\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 March 2019, the Speaker informed the House of Commons that a third meaningful vote could be held only on a motion that was significantly different from the previous one, citing parliamentary precedents going back to 1604..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement was brought back to the House without the attached understandings on 29 March. The Government\\\\s motion of support for the Withdrawal Agreement was defeated by 344 votes to 286âa loss by 58 votes, down from 149 when the deal had been proposed on 12 March..\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 March 2019, the Prime Minister wrote to European Council President Tusk requesting that Brexit be postponed until 30 June 2019. On 21 March 2019, May presented her case to a European Council summit meeting in Brussels. After May left the meeting, a discussion amongst the remaining EU leaders resulted in the rejection of 30 June date and offered instead a choice of two new alternative Brexit dates. On 22 March 2019, the extension options were agreed between the British government and the European Council. The first alternative offered was that if MPs rejected May\\\\s deal in the next week, Brexit would be due to occur by 12 April 2019, with, or without, a dealâor alternatively another extension be asked for and a commitment to participate in the 2019 European Parliament elections given. The second alternative offered was that if MPs approved May\\\\s deal, Brexit would be due to occur on 22 May 2019. The later date was the day before the start of European Parliament elections. After the government deemed unwarranted the concerns over the legality of the proposed change (because it contained two possible exit dates) the previous day, on 27 March 2019 both the Lords (without a vote) and the Commons (by 441 to 105) approved the statutory instrument changing the exit date to 22 May 2019 if a withdrawal deal is approved, or 12 April 2019 if it is not. The amendment was then signed into law at 12:40 p.m. the next day..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the failure of the British Parliament to approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March, the UK was required to leave the EU on 12 April 2019. On 10 April 2019, late-night talks in Brussels resulted in a further extension, to 31 October 2019; Theresa May had again requested an extension only until 30 June. Under the terms of this new extension, if the Withdrawal Agreement were to be passed before October, Brexit would occur on the first day of the subsequent month. The UK would then be obligated to hold European Parliament elections in May, or leave the EU on 1 June without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cIn granting the Article 50 extensions, the EU adopted a stance of refusing to reopen (that is, renegotiate) the Withdrawal Agreement..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Boris Johnson became prime minister on 24 July 2019 and met with EU leaders, the EU changed its stance. On 17 October 2019, following tunnel talks between UK and EU, a revised withdrawal agreement was agreed on negotiators level, and endorsed by the British government and the EU Commission. The revised deal contained a new Northern Ireland Protocol, as well as technical modifications to related articles. In addition, the Political Declaration was also revised. The revised deal and the political declaration was endorsed by the European Council later that day. To come into effect, it needed to be ratified by the European Parliament and the Parliament of the United Kingdom..\\\\c\\\\cThe British Parliament passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, which received Royal Assent on 9 September 2019, obliging the Prime Minister to seek a third extension if no agreement has been reached at the next European Council meeting in October 2019. In order for such an extension to be granted if it is requested by the Prime Minister, it would be necessary for there to be unanimous agreement by all other heads of EU governments. On 28 October 2019, the third extension was agreed to by the EU, with a new withdrawal deadline of 31 January 2020. \\\\Exit day\\\\ in British law was then amended to this new date by statutory instrument on 30 October 2019..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Johnson was unable to induce Parliament to approve a revised version of the withdrawal agreement by the end of October, he chose to call for a snap election. The House of Commons supported the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 by 438â20, setting the election date for Thursday 12 December. Opinion polls up to polling day showed a firm lead for the Conservatives against Labour throughout the campaign..\\\\c\\\\cIn the run-up to the general election on 12 December 2019 the Conservative Party pledged to leave the EU with the withdrawal agreement negotiated in October 2019. Labour promised to renegotiate aforementioned deal and hold a referendum, letting voters choose between the renegotiated deal and remain. The Liberal Democrats vowed to revoke Article 50, while the SNP intended to hold a second referendum, however, revoking Article 50 if the alternative was a no-deal exit. The DUP supported Brexit, but would seek to change parts related to Northern Ireland it was dissatisfied with. Plaid Cymru and the Green Party backed a second referendum, believing the UK should stay in the EU. The Brexit Party was the only major party running for election which wanted the UK to leave the EU without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cThe election produced a decisive result for Boris Johnson with the Conservatives winning 365 seats (gaining 47 seats) and a overall majority of 80 seats with Labour suffering their worst election defeat since 1935 after losing 60 seats to leave them with 202 seats and only a single seat in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats won just 11 seats with their leader Jo Swinson losing her own seat. The Scottish National Party won 48 seats after gaining 14 seats in Scotland..\\\\c\\\\cThe result broke the deadlock in the British Parliament and ended the possibility of a referendum being held on the withdrawal agreement and ensured that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on 31 January 2020..\\\\c\\\\cSubsequently, the government introduced a bill to ratify the withdrawal agreement. It passed its second reading in the House of Commons in a 358â234 vote on 20 December 2019, and became law on 23 January 2020.\\\\c\\\\cas the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020..\\\\c\\\\cThe withdrawal agreement received the backing of the constitutional committee in the European Parliament on 23 January 2020, setting expectation that the entire parliament would approve it in a later vote. On the following day, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel signed the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, and it was sent to London where Boris Johnson signed it. The European Parliament gave its consent to ratification on 29 January by 621 votes to 49. Immediately after voting approval, members of the European Parliament joined hands and sang Auld Lang Syne. The Council of the European Union concluded EU ratification the following day..\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 January 2020 at 11 p.m. GMT, the United Kingdom\\\\s membership of the European Union ended 47 years after it joined..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the British exit on 31 January 2020 the UK entered a Transition Period. Trade, travel and freedom of movement remain largely unchanged during this period. The transition period ended at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET) on 31 December 2020..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement still applies after this date. This agreement provides free access of goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, provided checks are made to goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The British Government attempted to back out of this commitment by passing the Internal Market Bill: domestic legislation in the British Parliament. In September, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said:.\\\\c\\\\cleading to the resignation of Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department and Lord Keen, the law officer for Scotland. The EU started legal action..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the transition period, David Frost and Michel Barnier continued to negotiate a permanent trade agreement. On 24 December 2020 both parties announced that a deal had been reached. The deal was passed by both houses of the British parliament on 30 December and given Royal Assent in the early hours of the next day. The transition period concluded under its terms the following evening. After the UK said it would unilaterally extend a grace period limiting checks on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the European Parliament postponed setting a date to ratify the agreement..\\\\c\\\\cIn October 2016, Theresa May promised a Great Repeal Bill, which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in British law all enactments previously in force under EU law. Subsequently renamed the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, it was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017..\\\\c\\\\cOn 12 September 2017, the bill passed its first vote and second reading by a margin of 326 votes to 290 votes in the House of Commons. The bill was further amended on a series of votes in both Houses. After the Act became law on 26 June 2018, the European Council decided on 29 June to renew its call on Member States and European Union institutions to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act fixed the period ending 21 January 2019 for the government to decide on how to proceed if the negotiations had not reached agreement in principle on both the withdrawal arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and EU; while, alternatively, making future ratification of the withdrawal agreement as a treaty between the UK and EU depend upon the prior enactment of another act of Parliament for approving the final terms of withdrawal when the Brexit negotiations were completed. In any event, the act did not alter the two-year period for negotiating allowed by Article 50 that ended at the latest on 29 March 2019 if the UK had not by then ratified a withdrawal agreement or agreed a prolongation of the negotiating period..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act which became law in June 2018 allowed for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. It authorises the government to bring into force, by order made under section 25, the provisions that fixed exit day and the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972, but exit day must be the same day and time as when the EU Treaties ceased to apply to the UK..\\\\c\\\\cExit day was the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11.00 p.m. GMT). The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by a British Statutory Instrument on 11 April 2019), in section 20 (1), defined \\\\exit day\\\\ as 11:00 p.m. on 31 October 2019. Originally, \\\\exit day\\\\ was defined as 11:00 p.m. on 29 March 2019 GMT (UTC+0)..\\\\c\\\\cA report published in March 2017 by the Institute for Government commented that, in addition to the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, primary and secondary legislation will be needed to cover the gaps in policy areas such as customs, immigration and agriculture. The report also commented that the role of the devolved legislatures was unclear, and could cause problems, and as many as 15 new additional Brexit Bills may be required, which would involve strict prioritisation and limiting Parliamentary time for in-depth examination of new legislation..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2016 and 2017, the House of Lords published a series of reports on Brexit-related subjects, including:.\\\\c\\\\cThe Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018, relating to withdrawal from Euratom, was presented to Parliament in October 2017. The act makes provision about nuclear safeguards, and for connected.\\\\c\\\\cpurposes. The Secretary of State may by regulations (nuclear safeguards regulations) make provision for the purpose of â (a) ensuring that qualifying nuclear material, facilities or.\\\\c\\\\cequipment are available only for use for civil activities (whether in the UK or elsewhere), or (b) giving effect to provisions of a relevant international agreement..\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling overall showed an initial fall in support for Brexit from the referendum to late 2016, when responses were split evenly between support and opposition. Support rose again to a plurality, which held until the 2017 general election. Since then, opinion polls tended to show a plurality of support for remaining in the EU or for the view that Brexit was a mistake, with the estimated margin increasing until a small decrease in 2019 (to 53% Remain : 47% Leave, as of October 2019[update]). This seems to be largely due to a preference for remaining in the EU among those who did not vote in 2016\\\\s referendum (an estimated 2.5 million of whom, as of October 2019[update], were too young to vote at the time). Other reasons suggested include slightly more Leave voters than Remain voters (14% and 12% of each, respectively, as of October 2019[update]) changing how they would vote (particularly in Labour areas) and the deaths of older voters, most of whom voted to leave the EU..\\\\c\\\\cOne estimate of demographic changes (ignoring other effects) implies that had an EU referendum taken place in October 2019,[update] there would have been between 800,000 and 900,000 fewer Leave voters and between 600,000 and 700,000 more Remain voters, resulting in a Remain majority..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2019, a petition submitted to the British Parliament petitions website, calling on the government to revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU, reached a record-level of more than 6.1 million signatures..\\\\c\\\\cPost-referendum opinion polling.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK was right or wrong to vote to leave the EU.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, including Neither responses.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, excluding Neither responses and normalised.\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Brexit referendum, the Scottish Government â led by the Scottish National Party (SNP) â planned another independence referendum because Scotland voted to remain in the EU while England and Wales voted to leave. It had suggested this before the Brexit referendum. The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, requested a referendum be held before the UK\\\\s withdrawal, but the British Prime Minister rejected this timing. The Scottish Parliament voted in favour of holding another independence referendum, with Sturgeon planning it for 2021. At the referendum in 2014, 55% of voters had decided to remain in the UK, but the referendum on Britain\\\\s withdrawal from the EU was held in 2016, with 62% of Scottish voters against it. In the event that Northern Ireland remains associated with the EU â for example, by remaining in the Customs Union â it is expected that Scotland will also insist on special treatment..\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 March 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Scottish Continuity Bill. This was passed by stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court\\\\s judgement, designated itself under Schedule 4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament. The bill has therefore not received royal assent..\\\\c\\\\cOn 19 December 2018, the EU Commission revealed its no-deal Contingency Action Plan in specific sectors, in respect of the UK leaving the EU in 100 days\\\\ time..\\\\c\\\\cIn the wake of the United Kingdom\\\\s vote to leave the European Union, the Department for International Trade (DIT) for reaching and extending trade agreements between the UK and non-EU states was created by Prime Minister May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016. By 2017, it employed about 200 trade negotiators and was overseen by then Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox. In March 2019, the British government announced that it would cut many import tariffs to zero, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Confederation of British Industry said the move would be a sledgehammer for our economy, and the National Farmer\\\\s Union was also highly critical. Additionally, the plan appeared to breach standard WTO rules..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 June 2020, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel stated that the European Union must prepare for the possible failure of Brexit trade talks with the UK. She added that negotiations were being accelerated to try and reach a deal that could be ratified by the end of the year. Her warning came as the deadline for extending talks passed away, with negotiations expected to end on 31 December with or without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cThere has been litigation to explore the constitutional footings on which Brexit stands after R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (simply known as the Miller case) and the 2017 Notification Act:.\\\\c\\\\cIn R. (Webster) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, a Divisional Court of Gross LJ and Green MR determined that the substantive decision to leave the EU that was notified on 29 March 2017 was in fact the executive decision of the Prime Minister using a statutory power of decision found to have been delegated to her by the Notification Act: this is confirmed by the House of Commons Library commentary on the case. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal and paragraph 15 of the judgement, along with the citable nature of the decision were upheld.  While the case was criticised academically by Robert Craig, who lectures in jurisprudence at the London School of Economics, aspects of the case\\\\s analysis were supported by the Supreme Court in Miller 2 at paragraph 57, which confirmed that:.\\\\c\\\\cThis confirmation that the decision was an executive act was part of the basis of R. (Wilson) v. Prime Minister which allied this point with the concerns about the irregularities in the referendum.  The High Court hearing was on 7 December 2018 before Ouseley MJ and when judgement was given it was held that: courtsâ job was not to rule on irregularities in the âleaveâ campaign as these were not questions of law; it was also said that the case was brought both too early and too late. Judgement in the Court of Appeal (before Hickinbottom LJ and Haddon-Cave LJ) before also went against the applicant..\\\\c\\\\cRegarding the reversibility of a notification under Article 50, Wightman and others v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union was referred to Court of Justice of the European Union; the UK government sought to block this referral, taking the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court, but was unsuccessful. On 10 December 2018, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notification..\\\\c\\\\cMany effects of Brexit depended on whether the UK left with a withdrawal agreement, or before an agreement was ratified (no-deal Brexit). In 2017, the Financial Times said that there were approximately 759 international agreements, spanning 168 non-EU countries, that the UK would no longer be a party to upon leaving the EU..\\\\c\\\\cEconomists expect that Brexit will have damaging immediate and longer term effects on the economies of the UK and at least part of the EU27. In particular, there is a broad consensus among economists and in the economic literature that Brexit will likely reduce the UK\\\\s real per capita income in the medium and long term, and that the Brexit referendum itself damaged the economy. Studies found that Brexit-induced uncertainty reduced British GDP, British national income, investment by business, employment and British international trade from June 2016 onwards..\\\\c\\\\cA 2019 analysis found that British firms substantially increased offshoring to the EU after the Brexit referendum, whereas European firms reduced new investments in the UK. The British government\\\\s own Brexit analysis, leaked in January 2018, showed that British economic growth would be stunted by 2â8% over the 15 years following Brexit, the amount depending on the leave scenario. Economists warned that London\\\\s future as an international financial centre depended on passport agreements with the EU. Pro-Brexit activists and politicians have argued for negotiating trade and migration agreements with the CANZUK countriesâthose of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdomâbut economists have said that trade deals with those countries would be far less valuable to the UK than EU membership. Studies project that Brexit will exacerbate regional economic inequality in the UK, by hitting already-struggling regions the hardest..\\\\c\\\\cThe potential impact on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been a contentious issue. Since 2005, the border has been essentially invisible. After Brexit, it became the only UKâEU land border  (not counting the land border between the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar with Spain). All involved parties agree a hard border should be avoided, as it might compromise the Good Friday Agreement that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. To forestall this, the EU proposed a backstop agreement (the Northern Ireland Protocol) that would have kept the UK in the Customs Union and kept Northern Ireland in some aspects of the Single Market also, until a lasting solution was found. The backstop was part of the withdrawal agreement, but was replaced in the revised agreement..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit caused the European Union to lose its second-largest economy, its third-most populous country, and the second-largest net contributor to the EU budget. Brexit will result in an additional financial burden for the remaining net contributors, unless the budget is reduced accordingly. The UK will no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, where it has 16% of the shares. Analyses indicate that the departure of the relatively economically liberal UK will reduce the ability of remaining economically liberal countries to block measures in the Council of the EU. In 2019, ahead of Brexit, the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority moved their headquarters from London to Amsterdam and Paris, respectively..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which provides government financial support to farmers in the EU. The UK receives much less than it contributes. Brexit allows the UK to develop its own agriculture policy. The current UK government has committed to maintaining the same payments to farmers until the end of the current parliament, even without a withdrawal agreement. The Agriculture Bill is intended to replace the CAP with a new system. The UK will also leave the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) that lets all EU countries fish within 12 nautical miles of the British coast and lets the EU set catch quotas. The combined EU fishing fleets land about six million tonnes of fish per year, about half of which are from British waters. By leaving the CFP, the UK could develop its own fisheries policy. The UK will also leave the London Fisheries Convention that lets Irish, French, Belgian, Dutch and German vessels fish within six nautical miles of the UK\\\\s coast..\\\\c\\\\cGibraltar, a British Overseas Territory bordering Spain, will be affected by Brexit. Spain asserts a territorial claim on Gibraltar. After the referendum, Spain\\\\s Foreign Minister renewed calls for joint SpanishâBritish control. In late 2018, the British and Spanish governments agreed that any dispute over Gibraltar would not affect Brexit negotiations, and the British government agreed that UKâEU treaties made after Brexit would not automatically apply to Gibraltar..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit poses challenges to British academia and research, as the UK is likely to lose research funding from EU sources; see a reduction in students from the EU; find it harder to hire researchers from the EU; and British students will find it harder to study abroad in the EU. The UK is currently a member of the European Research Area and likely to wish to remain an associated member following Brexit. The British government has guaranteed funding for research currently funded by EU..\\\\c\\\\cAn early 2019 study found that Brexit would deplete the National Health Service (NHS) workforce, create uncertainties regarding care for British nationals living in the EU, and put at risk access to vaccines, equipment, and medicines. The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has taken steps to ensure the continuity of medical supplies after Brexit.  The number of non-British EU nurses registering with the NHS fell from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April 2017..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will have the final say over the laws that govern it. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, EU laws will no longer have supremacy over British laws after Brexit. To maintain continuity, the Act converts EU law into British law as retained EU law. After Brexit, the British parliament (and the devolved legislatures) can decide which elements of that law to keep, amend or repeal. Furthermore, British courts will no longer be bound by the judgments of the EU Court of Justice after Brexit..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK would be able to control immigration from the EU and EEA, as it can end EU freedom of movement. The current British government intends to replace it with a new system. The government\\\\s 2018 white paper proposes a skills-based immigration system that prioritizes skilled migrants. EU and EEA citizens already living in the UK can continue living there after Brexit by applying to the EU Settlement Scheme, which began in March 2019. Irish citizens will not have to apply to the scheme. Studies estimate that Brexit and the end of free movement will likely result in a large decline in immigration from EEA countries to the UK. After Brexit, any foreigner wanting to do so more than temporarily would need a work permit..\\\\c\\\\cBy leaving the EU, the UK would leave the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA), a single market in commercial air travel, but could negotiate a number of different future relationships with the EU. British airlines would still have permission to operate within the EU with no restrictions, and vice versa. The British government seeks continued participation in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The UK has its own air service agreements with 111 countries, which permit flights to-and-from the country, and further 17 countries through its EU membership. These have since been replaced. Ferries will continue, but with obstacles such as customs checks. New ferry departures between the Republic of Ireland and the European mainland have been established. As of August 2020[update], the government\\\\s Goods Vehicle Movement Service, an IT system essential to post-Brexit goods movements, was still only in the early stages of beta testing, with four months to go before it is required to be in operation..\\\\c\\\\cConcerns have been raised that Brexit might create security problems for the UK, particularly in law enforcement and counter-terrorism where the UK could use the EU\\\\s databases on individuals crossing the British border..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit has inspired many creative works, such as murals, sculptures, novels, plays, movies and video games. The response of British artists and writers to Brexit has in general been negative, reflecting a reported overwhelming percentage of people involved in Britain\\\\s creative industries voting against leaving the European Union. Despite issues around immigration being central in the Brexit debate, British artists left the migrants\\\\ perspective largely unexplored. However, Brexit also inspired UK-based migrant artists to create new works and claim agency over their representation within public spaces and create a platform for a new social imagination that can facilitate transnational and trans-local encounters, multicultural democratic spaces, sense of commonality, and solidarity. .\\\\c\\\\cAnti-Brexit protest in Manchester (2017) by sculptor Jacques Tilly.\\\\c\\\\cDuÌsseldorf carnival parade in February 2018 by German by sculptor Jacques Tilly\\n',\n"," 'On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Mexican American boy, was fatally shot by Chicago Police Department officer Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. Bodycam footage of the shooting was released publicly on April 15..\\\\c\\\\cAdam Toledo was a seventh-grader at Gary Elementary School from the Little Village neighborhood in Chicago. He was 13 years old when the incident occurred..\\\\c\\\\cRuben Roman is a 21-year-old arrested by the Chicago PD at the scene..\\\\c\\\\cEric Stillman is the 34-year-old officer who killed Toledo. He was placed on administrative leave for 30 days following the incident.  Originally, police said Stillman had no complaints on his record. According to the organization that runs the police database however, he had three complaints and four use of force reports on his record at the time of the shooting..\\\\c\\\\cProsecutors alleged that at around 2:30 a.m., Toledo and Roman were walking toward 24th Street when Roman fired multiple rounds as a vehicle passed. Police ShotSpotter detector technology registered shots fired and a squad car arrived at the scene. According to prosecutors\\\\ initial claims, Toledo ran away from the officers, was chased into an alleyway, turned back to the officer with a gun in his hand, and was then shot in the chest. The police claimed a handgun was recovered at the scene from behind a fence after an armed confrontation..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 15, 2021, however, the released body cam footage of Toledoâs shooting showed he was unarmed at the moment of the shooting. The video shows the officer chasing Toledo into the alleyway, where Toledo slows down and stops. In footage taken from another angle, it appears that he tosses a weapon away, over a fence. The officer points a strobe flashlight at him and yells Show me your fucking hands. Toledo then turns around with his hands up. As he does so, the officer yells drop it, and Toledo is shot by the officer. Toledo was not holding a gun when he was shot, but it is uncertain if he was armed in the moments leading up to being shot..\\\\c\\\\cAfter shooting Toledo, officer Stillman calls for medical assistance and begins to perform CPR..\\\\c\\\\cChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has called for reforms to how police pursue individuals on foot and called for a thorough, expeditious investigation. Officials have said they are in the very early stages of interviewing witnesses and officers..\\\\c\\\\cIn the lead up to the release of the body cam footage, all Chicago police officers\\\\ days off were cancelled to ensure public safety. During the press conference releasing the body cam footage, Mayor Lightfoot also stated that the city would be putting into place plans to prepare for unrest..\\\\c\\\\cToledo is believed to be the youngest person killed by the Chicago Police Department in several decades..\\\\c\\\\cProtests have occurred in Chicago in the days following Toledo\\\\s death..\\\\c\\\\cColumnist Eric Zorn wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune saying it was too early to say with confidence what happened and thus Toledo should not be portrayed as a martyr until more facts come out. His comments were received with outrage. Days later in another op-ed, Zorn wrote that the less supportive response ... took fair exception to my chilly, analytical tone ... I regret that tone. In focusing on details and marshaling evidence and arguments, I can neglect the emotional resonance in situations, as though I\\\\ve forgotten or don\\\\t care that a child who was loved has died, and that the death of someone with so much life ahead of him is always, always a tragedy. I should have done better..\\\\c\\\\cThe writer Roxanne Gay said, The Adam Toledo video was so horrifying that Chicago boarded up municipal buildings before the video was released. That tells you all you need to know..\\\\c\\\\cThe journalist Maria Hinojosa stated, Adam Toledo was a child. Not a threat..\\\\c\\\\cCongressman Joaquin Castro wrote on Twitter, Adam Toledo was 13-years-old. He complied and had his hands up. Chicago police killed him with a shot to the chest and then lied that he posed an imminent threat. The Toledo family deserves justice and accountability. His brother, former-Secretary Julian Castro, wrote, Chicago PD shot Adam Toledo with his hands in the air instantaneously after ordering him to do soâthen lied about it. They executed Adam, a boy who was not yet in high school. Indict this officer, then pass a national use of force standard immediately..\\\\c\\\\cSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote, Adam Toledo was just 13 years old. He was a child. This is heartbreaking. He deserves justice. His family deserves justice..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 1, 2021, Chicago Police Department alerted its officers that Latin Kings ranked members were instructed to open fire at unmarked police cruisers to retaliate for the shooting of Adam Toledo. The warning was prioritized to officers in Little Village, between Lawndale Avenue and Whipple Street.\\n',\n"," 'The GazaâIsrael conflict is a part of the localized IsraeliâPalestinian conflict, but is also a scene of power struggle between regional powers including Egypt, Iran and Turkey together with Qatar, supporting different sides of the conflict in light of the regional standoff between Iran and Saudi Arabia on one hand and between Qatar and Saudi Arabia on the other, as well as crisis in Egyptian-Turkish relations..\\\\c\\\\cThe conflict originated with the election of the Islamist political party Hamas in 2005 and 2006 in the Gaza Strip and escalated with the split of the Palestinian Authority Palestinian government into the Fatah government in the West Bank  and the Hamas government in Gaza and the following violent ousting of Fatah after Fatah lost the election to Hamas. Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, and the joint Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza have exacerbated the conflict. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets illegal under international law..\\\\c\\\\cAs part of its 2005 disengagement plan, Israel retained exclusive control over Gaza\\\\s airspace and territorial waters, continued to patrol and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of its southernmost border (where Egypt retained control of the border and border crossings were supervised by European monitors) and continued to monitor and blockade Gaza\\\\s coastline. Israel largely provides and controls Gaza\\\\s water supply, electricity and communications infrastructure.  According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Israel remains an occupying power under international law. The United Nations has stated that under resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, it regards Gaza to be part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Meanwhile, the Fatah government in the West Bank, internationally recognized as the sole representative of the State of Palestine, refers to the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian state and does not recognize the Hamas government..\\\\c\\\\cThe IsraelâGaza barrier, completed in 1996, has helped reduce infiltration from Gaza Strip into Israel.[citation needed] Since the beginning of the Second Intifada, Gazans have not been permitted to enter Israel for work purposes. Special permits to enter Israel for medical purposes were also greatly reduced,[citation needed] which has made travel for Palestinians difficult..\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Schueftan, in his 1999 book, Disengagement: Israel and the Palestinian Entity (The Need for Separation: Israel and the Palestinian Authority) reviews new and existing arguments underlying different separation stances, in order to make the case for separation from the Palestinians, beginning with those in the West Bank and Gaza. Schueftan favors the hard separation stances of politicians like Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak..\\\\c\\\\cYitzhak Rabin was the first to propose the creation of a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations in 1992, and by 1994, construction on the first barrier â the IsraelâGaza barrier â had begun; it is actually a wire fence equipped with sensors. Following an attack on Bet Lid, near the city of Netanya, Rabin specified the objectives behind the undertaking, stating that:.\\\\c\\\\cThe Second Intifada, also known as the al-Aqsa Intifada, began in September 2000. Many Palestinians consider the Intifada to be a struggle of national liberation against Israeli occupation imposed on them following the 1967 War, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cPalestinian tactics have ranged from carrying out mass protests and general strikes, as in the First Intifada, to mounting suicide bombing attacks and firing Qassam rockets into east southern Israeli residential areas. Israeli tactics range from conducting mass arrests and locking up Palestinians in administrative detention through setting up checkpoints and building the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier and West Bank barrier to carrying out assassinations targeting militants and leaders of Palestinian organizations..\\\\c\\\\cSince the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Israel has been negotiating with Mahmoud Abbas and the PLO, but has been simultaneously targeting and bombing Hamas activists and militants and arresting Hamas\\\\s elected legislative counsel politicians..\\\\c\\\\cThe death toll, both military and civilian, over the entire period in question (2000â2007) is estimated to be over 4,300 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis. To date, 64 foreign citizens have also been killed (54 by Palestinians, and 10 by Israeli security forces)..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael implemented its Disengagement Plan in AugustâSeptember 2005, withdrawing its civilian and military presence from the Gaza Strip, and retaining control over the Gaza airspace, maritime access and borders even with Egypt according to the 2005 agreement with Palestinian authority. Qassam rockets were fired regularly prior to the Israeli disengagement and the frequency of Qassam attacks increased after the Disengagement from Gaza. Palestinian militants have targeted a number of military bases and civilian towns in Southern Israel..\\\\c\\\\cSince 2001, Palestinian militants have launched thousands of rocket and mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip. Thirteen Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured as a result of Qassam rocket fire at Israeli targets. Additionally, Qassam rocket attacks have resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in both children and adults, with 33% of children living in Sderot suffering from PTSD..\\\\c\\\\cWhen the Islamic party Hamas won the January 2006 Palestinian legislative election, gaining a majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, the conflict between Israel and Gaza intensified. Israel sealed its border with the Gaza Strip, largely preventing free flow of people and many imports and exports. Palestinians have been shooting Qassam rockets at Israeli settlements located near the Gaza borders, and have staged cross-border raids aimed at killing or capturing Israeli soldiers. In one such raid, on 25 June 2006, Palestinians captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, leading to massive retaliation by the Israeli army which included air strikes against Hamas targets..\\\\c\\\\cIn June 2007, internal fighting broke out between Hamas and Fatah and Hamas fully consolidated its power by staging an armed coup d\\\\eÌtat and taking control of the Gaza Strip.  Following the internecine fighting that occurred between 7 and 15 June 2007, also known as the Battle of Gaza 2007 in which 118 Palestinians were killed and over 550 were wounded, the entire Gaza Strip came under full control of a Hamas government..\\\\c\\\\cAs a response to the Hamas takeover, Israel sharply restricted the flow of people and goods into and out of Gaza. About 70% of Gaza\\\\s workforce have become unemployed or without pay, and about 80% of its residents live in poverty..\\\\c\\\\cSince Hamas\\\\ takeover, Palestinian armed groups in Gaza and Israel continued to clash. Palestinian armed groups have fired rockets into Israel, killing Israeli civilians, including children, and wounding others, as well as causing damage to infrastructure; and Israel have launched attacks, and shelled Gaza with artillery, killing Palestinian combatants as well as civilians, including children, and causing devastating damage to infrastructure. According to Human Rights Watch, the Palestinian deliberate attacks against civilians violate international humanitarian law. Because Hamas exercises power inside Gaza, it is responsible for stopping unlawful attacks even when carried out by other groups..\\\\c\\\\cLarge-scale conventional warfare beyond the peripheries of the Gaza Strip began when Palestinian militants abducted Corporal Gilad Shalit, and Israel responded by launching Operation Summer Rains on 28 June 2006. The operation became the first major mobilization within the Gaza Strip since Israel unilaterally disengaged from the region between August and September 2005..\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza beach blast was an event on 9 June 2006 in which eight Palestinians were killed â including nearly the entire family of seven-year-old Huda Ghaliya â and at least thirty others were injured in an explosion on a beach near the municipality of Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip. The incident received considerable attention from news media worldwide, with blame for the explosion hotly disputed in the following weeks..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael maintains that it mobilized thousands of troops in order to suppress Qassam rocket fire against its civilian population and to secure the release of Gilad Shalit. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 9,000 Israeli artillery shells were fired into Gaza between September 2005 and June 2006, killing 80 Palestinians in 6 months. On the Palestinian side, over 1,300 Qassam rockets have been fired into Israel from September 2000 to 21 December 2006.[citation needed] Israeli forces also continued to search for tunnels, used by militants to smuggle weapons, as well as monitor operations at checkpoints (with some assistance from the European Union at Rafah) for security reasons, specifically possible weapons transfers and uninhibited return of exiled extremist leaders and terrorists. As of 18 October 2006, Israel has discovered 20 tunnels used for illegal arms smuggling under the border of the Gaza Strip and Egypt..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael had said it would withdraw from the Strip and end the operation as soon as Shalit was released. The Palestinians had said that they were willing to return Shalit in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The Palestinians and others have also said the assault was aimed at toppling the democratically elected Hamas-led government and at destabilizing the Palestinian National Authority, citing the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as a power station and the captures of government and parliament members. Some 300 Palestinians had been targeted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit..\\\\c\\\\cIn July 2006, first reports emerged about mystery injuries after Israeli attacks. Previously unseen injuries included severely damaged internal organs, severe internal burning and deep internal wounds often resulting in amputations or death. Bodies arrived severely fragmented, melted and disfigured. There were speculations about a new experimental weapon, particularly Dense Inert Metal Explosives (DIMEs)..\\\\c\\\\cAttempting to curb Qassam rocket attacks fired at Southern Israel by Palestinian militants from the northern Gaza Strip,.\\\\c\\\\cIsrael launched Operation Autumn Clouds on 1 November 2006..\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 November 2006, a day after Israel\\\\s withdrawal following Operation Autumn Clouds, Israel Defense Forces shells missed their targetâpossibly due to a technical malfunctionâand hit a row of houses in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, killing 19 Palestinians and wounding more than 40. Israeli Defense Forces launched an investigation into the Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident (and later apologized for the incident), and the then Israeli President Ehud Olmert offered humanitarian assistance to those affected..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2006 FrancoâItalianâSpanish Middle East Peace Plan was proposed after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in Operation Autumn Clouds by Spanish Premier JoseÌ Luis RodriÌguez Zapatero during talks with French president Jacques Chirac. Italy\\\\s prime minister Romano Prodi gave his full support to the plan..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 November, a ceasefire was signed by Palestinian organisations and Israel, and Israel withdrew its troops while the Palestinian Authority forces deployed to stop Qassam rocket launchings. Following the truce over 60 Qassam rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip at Israel, and 1 Palestinian (armed with guns and grenades) was killed by the IDF. On 19 December, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad began taking open responsibility for the Qassam rocket firing, because they said Israel killed two of their members in Jenin..\\\\c\\\\cA series of battles between Palestinian militants in Hamas-governed Gaza and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that began in mid-May 2007, with the inter-Palestinian violence flaring in the meantime. Palestinians fired more than 220 Qassam rocket attacks on Israel (Sderot and the western Negev) in more than a week. The Israeli Air Force fired missiles and bombs at the launching sites. The fighting came amid serious Palestinian factional violence and reports of growing level of humanitarian crisis in the region. Hamas said they will continue to retaliate against Israeli strikes..\\\\c\\\\cIn September 2007, citing an intensification of Qassam rocket attacks, Israel declared Gaza hostile territory. The declaration allowed Israel to prevent the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into Gaza. The stated purpose of this blockade was to pressure Hamas into ending the rocket attacks and to deprive them of the supplies necessary for the continuation of rocket attacks. Israel\\\\s decision to cut fuel supplies to Gaza were widely condemned as collective punishment..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael has also arrested Hamas officials in the West Bank, including two cabinet members. Such arrests have been strongly condemned by international organizations and politicians..\\\\c\\\\cBy January 2008, according to a United Nations study, the economic effects of Israel\\\\s blockade on Gaza reached a critical threshold. Finally, on 17 January 2008, Israel sealed the border completely following a rise in rocket attacks. The breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January 2008, after gunmen in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah Border Crossing, destroying part of the former Israeli Gaza Strip barrier. The United Nations estimates that as many as half the 1.5 million population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 February 2008, Palestinian militants fired more than 40 Qassam rockets into southern Israel and the Israeli army fired three missiles at the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza destroying the building. On 28 February 2008 Israeli aircraft bombed a police station near the Gaza City home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, killing several children. The Israeli military says its air and ground operations against militants firing rockets from northern Gaza have hit at least 23 armed Palestinians, while Palestinian sources have reported higher death tolls and say many civilians have also been killed..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael began its air and ground operations on 29 February. The IDF\\\\s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 100 Palestinians in less than a week. Palestinians fired 150 rockets at Israel which killed three Israelis. The United States called for an end to clashes between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has accused Israel of international terrorism, saying its assault on Gaza constitutes more than a holocaust. On 3 March Abbas suspended all contact with Israel over its assault on Gaza as the Israeli government sent warplanes to hit more targets early on Monday and vowed to continue its offensive. The European Union condemned what it called disproportionate use of force by the Israeli military in Gaza after 54 Palestinians were killed in the highest casualty toll for a single day since fighting erupted in 2000. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also issued a condemnation of what he termed Israel\\\\s excessive and disproportionate response, and called on Israel to cease such attacks, while denouncing the ongoing rocket attacks on Sderot and Ashkelon. In the Muslim world, demonstrators took to the streets to protest the IDF attacks. Iran\\\\s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Muslims to rise up and their leaders to hit Israel in the face with their nations\\\\ anger. In Lebanon, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters gathered at the Fatima Gate at the border between Lebanon and Israel, shouting Death to Israel and waving Lebanese and Palestinian flags. In Egypt, thousands of students held protests at universities across the country calling on Arab leaders to stop Israeli aggression and support the Palestinians. Some protesters burned Israeli and American flags. About 10,000 protesters, mainly from Jordan\\\\s mainstream Muslim Brotherhood and smaller opposition groups, took to the streets in one of the country\\\\s most vocal and largest anti-Israeli demonstrations in recent years. Saudi Arabia meanwhile compared the IDF offensive to Nazi war crimes and called on the international community to stop what it called the mass killings of Palestinians. Turkey\\\\s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the IDF attacks can have no humanitarian justification and added that Israel was rejecting a diplomatic solution to the dispute. Most Israeli tanks and troops pulled out of northern Gaza 3 March 2008, and an Israel Defense Forces spokesman confirmed that the Israeli military was ending offensive operations there after five days..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 February 2008, the Israeli military launched Operation Hot Winter (also called Operation Warm Winter) in response to Qassam rockets fired from the Strip by Hamas. The Israeli army killed 112 Palestinians, and Palestinian militants killed three Israelis. More than 150 Palestinians and seven Israelis have been injured..\\\\c\\\\cThere was widespread international alarm at the scale of the operation, with the US state department encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life, and the European Union and the United Nations criticising Israel\\\\s disproportionate use of force. The European Union also demanded an immediate end to Palestinian militant rocket attacks on Israel and urged Israel to halt activities that endanger civilians, saying they were in violation of international law..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2008 IsraelâHamas ceasefire was an Egyptian-brokered six-month Tahdia (an Arabic term for a lull) for the Gaza area, which went into effect between Hamas and Israel on 19 June 2008. Hamas\\\\ obligation was to stop the rocket attacks on Israel. During the initial 5-months of the ceasefire, and after a shaky start during the initial week, these attacks from Gaza decreased significantly for a total of 19 rocket and 18 mortar shell launchings, compared to 1199 rockets and 1072 mortar shells in 2008 up to 19 June, a reduction of 98%.  Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister acknowledged that there were no Hamas rockets during the ceasefire before November the 4th. Israel\\\\s obligation was to cease attacks on Gaza and once the ceasefire held, to gradually begin to ease its punishing blockade of Gaza. The agreement called on Israel to increase the level of goods entering Gaza by 30 percent over the pre-lull period within 72 hours and to open all border crossings and allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza within 13 days after the beginning of the ceasefire.[better source needed] The increase in supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel did improve, but the increase was only to an average of about 20 percent of normal levels, compared to the Hamas compliance in reducing rocket fire by 98%. Two months later the volume of goods arriving was too low to significantly improved living conditions, preventing UNRWA from replenishing its stores. Israel told U.S. officials in 2008 it would keep Gaza\\\\s economy on the brink of collapse..\\\\c\\\\cOn 4 November 2008 Israel broke the ceasefire with an attack on Gaza. The Israeli military claimed the target of the raid was a tunnel that they said Hamas was planning to use to capture Israeli soldiers positioned on the border fence 250m away. Hamas officials differed, however, claiming that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes, not to capture IDF personnel, according to Dr Robert Pastor (of the Carter Institute), and an IDF official confirmed that fact to him. Hamas replied to the Israeli attack with a barrage of rocket fire. With this incursion into Gaza territory and its non-compliance with the easing of the embargo, Israel had failed to comply with two aspects of the June 2008 ceasefire..\\\\c\\\\cWhen the six-month truce officially expired on 19 December, Hamas launched 50 to more than 70 rockets and mortars into Israel over the next three days, though no Israelis were injured. On 21 December, Hamas said it was ready to stop the attacks and renew the truce if Israel stopped its aggression in Gaza and opened up its border crossings. On 27 and 28 December, Israel implemented Operation Cast Lead against Hamas. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said We warned Hamas repeatedly that rejecting the truce would push Israel to aggression against Gaza..\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza War started when Israel launched a large military campaign in the Gaza Strip on 27 December 2008, codenamed Operation Cast Lead (Hebrew: ×××¦×¢ ×¢××¤×¨×ª ××¦××§×), with the stated aim of stopping Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel and arms smuggling into Gaza. The conflict has also been called the Gaza massacre in the Arab world (Arabic: ÙØ¬Ø²Ø±Ø© ØºØ²Ø©). A fragile six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired on 19 December 2008. The Israeli operation began with an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas bases, police training camps, police headquarters and offices. Civilian infrastructure, including mosques, houses, medical facilities and schools, were also attacked, as Israel stated that many of them were used by combatants, and as storage spaces for weapons and rockets. Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against targets in Israel throughout the conflict, hitting previously untargeted cities such as Beersheba and Ashdod. On 3 January 2009, the Israeli ground invasion began. Human rights groups and aid organisations have accused Hamas and Israel of war crimes. An estimated 1,166-1,417 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in the conflict. The conflict came to an end on 18 January after first Israel and then Hamas announced unilateral ceasefires. On 21 January, Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. On 2 March, it was reported that international donors had pledged $4.5 billion in aid for the Palestinians, mainly for rebuilding Gaza after Israel\\\\s offensive. This war is considered to be the largest, devastating and deadliest military operation in Gaza since the Six-day war in 1967..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 March 2010, two Israeli soldiers and two Hamas militants were killed during clashes on the Gaza Strip\\\\s southern border. Two other soldiers were wounded during the fighting which broke out east of the town of Khan Younis. They are the first Israeli soldiers to have been killed in hostile fire in or around Gaza since Israel\\\\s major offensive there in January 2009, according to the BBC..\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 August 2011, a series of cross-border attacks was carried out in southern Israel near the Egyptian border, by a squad of militants. The militants first opened fire at civilian bus. Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel\\\\s border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the second week of March 2012, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation Returning Echo. It was the worst outbreak of violence covered by the media in the region since the 2008â09 Operation Cast Lead (the Gaza War)..\\\\c\\\\cAttacks by Israel and Gazans grew intense late in October 2012. An Israeli air strike killed Ahmed Jabari, chief of the Hamas military wing in Gaza. During the operation, four Israeli civilians and one soldier were killed by Palestinian rocket fire, according to Palestinian Centre for Human Rights 158 Palestinians had been killed, of which: 102 were civilians, 55 militants and one was policeman. 30 children and 13 women were among the killed, while the Israel Defense Forces presented statistics showing that out of 177 Palestinians killed, 120 were militants.  Most of the fighting was by bombs, aerial attacks, artillery, and rockets; the rockets being primarily used by the Palestinians and air strikes primarily by the Israelis. Attacked locations include Beersheva, Tel Aviv, Ashdod, Ofakim, Gaza, the rest of the Gaza Strip, the Shaar Hanegev, and Eshkol Regional Council. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and other Western countries expressed support for Israel\\\\s right to defend itself, and/or[clarification needed] condemned the Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. Iran, Egypt, Turkey, North Korea and several other Arab and Muslim countries condemned the Israeli operation..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2014, fighting intensified between Israel and Hamas, leading to another full-scale Gaza War, this one far deadlier than the previous in 2008â2009. The IDF launched Operation Protective Edge on 8 July 2014, in response to Hamas rocket attacks, which were launched following an earlier Israeli air strike against Gaza and on 17 July 2014, Israel troops entered the Gaza Strip. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the conflict. The war came to an end after 50 days of conflict when a ceasefire was agreed upon on 26 August 2014..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 2018 Land Day protests, 168 Palestinians have been killed and thousands were injured during clashes with Israeli troops at the Gaza-Israel border..\\\\c\\\\cViolence flared up again on 11 November 2018 when seven Palestinian militants were killed during a botched raid by the Israel Defense Forces in the southeastern Gaza Strip. One IDF officer was killed and another was injured. Over a dozen rockets were subsequently fired from Gaza, three of which were shot down. After a series of intense fire exchanges, ceasefire was agreed upon on 13 November 2018..\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 March, seven people were injured in Israel after a rocket attack destroyed a home in Mishmeret. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that Hamas was responsible for the attack..\\\\c\\\\cThe Israeli Air Force sent jets to strike multiple targets in the Gaza Strip, including the office of senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh, and Hamas\\\\ military intelligence headquarters in Gaza City..\\\\c\\\\cOn 3 May, two Israeli soldiers were injured by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper from in the Gaza Strip during the weekly protests at the GazaâIsrael border. In response, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike, killing four Palestinians. In addition, two other Palestinians were killed and 60 wounded, 36 of them by Israeli gunfire..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing this, Gazan militants launched hundreds of rockets at Israel. In response, the Israeli Air Force struck numerous targets within the Gaza Strip. In addition, Israel increased its troop presence near the GazaâIsrael border..\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 July 2014 on the 23rd day of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict, Ireland\\\\s Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said he shared the horror and revulsion of senators and very many of our citizens at the horrendous scenes we have witnessed since the start of the Israeli military operation. The Irish government, he said, condemned both the unacceptably high civilian casualty rate resulting from disproportionate military action on Israel\\\\s part as well as the firing of rockets by Hamas and other militants into Israel. On 5 August 2014 a member of the British cabinet resigned over the UK government\\\\s approach to the 2014 conflict..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the U.S. Presidential campaigns of 2016, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Israel for its treatment of Gaza, and in particular criticized Netanyahu for overreacting and causing unnecessary civilian deaths. In April 2016 the Anti-Defamation League called on Sanders to withdraw remarks he made to the New York Daily News, which the ADL said exaggerated the death toll of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict. Sanders said over 10,000 innocent people were killed, a number far in excess of Palestinian or Israel sources\\\\ estimates. In response, Sanders said that he accepted a corrected number of the death toll as 2,300 in the course of the interview and that he would make every effort to set the record straight. The transcript of the interview failed to note that Sanders said Okay to the corrected number presented by the interviewer during the course of the interview..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to NGOs and the UN, the recent wars and the blockade have led to worsting living conditions in Gaza and could be become unlivable by 2020..\\\\c\\\\cDue to the conflict, Israel has stepped up its defense measures in the southern communities and cities of Israel. This includes building fortifications on existing structures and bomb shelters, developing an alarm system (Red Color) and building an air-defense system (Iron Dome)\\n',\n"," 'On April 15, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Nine people were killed, including the gunman, 19-year-old former employee Brandon Scott Hole, who committed suicide. Four others were injured. Hole\\\\s motive remains unknown..\\\\c\\\\cThe FedEx facility where the shooting occurred is located in the southwestern part of the city, near Indianapolis International Airport. It is the company\\\\s second-busiest hub, with nearly 4,000 employees in total. The building is equipped with metal detectors and security turnstiles at its entrance requiring the employees to scan their FedEx badges. There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the shooting, and many of them were changing shifts or on dinner breaks..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt, the gunman entered the facility in a vehicle and, after exiting unprovoked, immediately began firing. Afterwards, the gunman entered the facility and began shooting again. The shooting lasted several minutes. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene shortly after 11:00 p.m. local time. However, the shooter took his own life by that point..\\\\c\\\\cThe shooting resulted in a brief closure of Interstate 70 at Ameriplex Parkway, which reopened shortly afterwards..\\\\c\\\\cThere were nine fatalities in the shooting, including the gunman. Excluding the gunman, four victims were found dead outside of the facility, with the other four being found dead inside. Five people were taken to the hospital, including one in critical condition; four of them suffered gunshot wounds..\\\\c\\\\cPolice identified the gunman as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old resident of Indiana who had been employed at the Indianapolis facility until 2020. After the shooting, authorities conducted a search of his home and seized evidence, including electronics..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2020, Hole\\\\s mother contacted the FBI and local authorities and warned them about her son\\\\s intent to commit suicide by cop, prompting a preliminary investigation to be opened. Hole was placed in a temporary mental health hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. They seized a shotgun from him, and the FBI questioned Hole about unspecified items found in his bedroom in April 2020. Eventually, the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence of any criminal violation, and the shotgun was not returned to Hole. Previously, in 2013, local police contacted Hole for unclear reasons..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 16, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. He and Vice President Kamala Harris released statements expressing their condolences with the victims\\\\ families. Later, during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, he decried the recent string of mass shootings in the United States as a national embarrassment and called on Congress to act on gun legislation.\\n']"]},"execution_count":611,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 5.65 ms (started: 2022-05-15 06:34:57 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["check_src_fur[:5]"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":396,"status":"ok","timestamp":1652944475473,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"Pi5j3Z2fKv8m","outputId":"2412ac2d-ce8c-4a46-fea6-a2865bd67a3e"},"outputs":[{"data":{"text/plain":["dict_keys(['title', 'event_time', 'title_update_time', 'event_link', 'title_update_link', 'update_bs4', 'title_non_update_link', 'title_non_update_time', 'non_update_bs4', 'article_title', 'source_news_first', 'source_news_full', 'article_record', 'update_all_paragraph_with_references', 'update_first_paragraph', 'update_all_paragraph', 'non_update_all_paragraph_with_references', 'non_update_all_paragraph', 'non_update_first_paragraph', 'update_wiki_summary', 'non_update_wiki_summary', 'wiki_portal_summary', 'citation_position', 'event_wcep_id'])"]},"execution_count":98,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 3.37 ms (started: 2022-05-19 07:14:34 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["clusters[0].keys()"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":405,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653269838151,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"bpDU-9CUNkAD","outputId":"914bd76e-0faa-45ab-d7f4-dc86bbcdc8c9"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs1_test/filtered_non\n","time: 130 ms (started: 2022-05-23 01:37:17 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["# tgt: udpate_all_paragraph\n","%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs1_test/filtered_non\n","tgt_clusters = []\n","check_output = []\n","\n","for idx in rmved_idx_en:\n","    cleaned_article = re.sub(r'\\[.*?\\]', \"\", clusters[idx]['update_all_paragraph'])\n","    output_article = str(cleaned_article).rstrip('\\n')\n","    output_article = str(output_article).rstrip()\n","    tgt_clusters.append(output_article.replace('\\n', '\\c'))"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":493,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653070880929,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"u9OPw1OJNmL0","outputId":"56702eed-671c-47bd-ba5e-b39c284a274d"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 670 ms (started: 2022-05-20 18:21:20 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["with open('test.txt.tgt', 'w') as fwrite:\n","    for line in tgt_clusters:\n","        fwrite.write('%s\\n' % line)\n","\n","with open('test.txt.tgt', 'r') as fread:\n","    for line in fread.readlines():\n","        check_output.append(line)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":125},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":398,"status":"ok","timestamp":1653070881323,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"L5sP-N0YIowQ","outputId":"e01a8be5-0f16-49f9-8814-9d3678626d8b"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'Jean-Pierre Bemba (born 4 November 1962) was one of four vice-presidents in the transitional government of the Democratic Republic of the Congo from 2003 to 2006. He was sworn in on 17 July 2003. Bemba also leads the Movement for the Liberation of Congo (MLC), a rebel group turned political party. He received the second highest number of votes in the 2006 presidential election. In January 2007 he was elected to the Senate.\\\\cBemba is one of the richest men in the Congo, with an estimated fortune of several hundred million dollars.  His businesses have included portable radios, aviation and private television stations. His father was a businessman who was successful under former Zairian dictator Mobutu Sese Seko, and one of his sisters is married to Mobutu\\'s son Nzanga, who was also a candidate in the 2006 presidential elections.\\\\cIn 2002, President Ange-FÃ©lix PatassÃ© of the Central African Republic invited the MLC to come to his country and put down a coup attempt; human rights activists have accused MLC fighters of committing atrocities against hundreds of suspected rebel sympathizers in the course of this conflict. In March 2003, PatassÃ© was ousted, and the government that replaced him pressed charges against PatassÃ© and Bemba in September 2004. International arrest warrants were issued, but because the new government was unable to have him arrested, the matter was referred to the International Criminal Court, whose Prosecutor has yet to decide whether an investigation needs to be opened. \\\\cBemba was one of 33 candidates who ran in the Congolese presidential election on 30 July, 2006. His main campaign slogan â \"One Hundred Percent Congolese\" â was widely perceived as an attack on frontrunner President Joseph Kabila. \\\\cDuring the campaign, he denied allegations of cannibalism, after opponents claimed that he had eaten pygmies during fighting in 2002. \"These are lies which have come from the highest levels of government...The pygmies are alive and well\" he responded. \\\\cBemba received substantial support in the western, Lingala-speaking portion of the country, including the capital, Kinshasa. Following the vote there was significant tension as to whether the results would give Kabila a majority of the vote, in which case there would not be a second round against Bemba, who was perceived as Kabila\\'s main opponent. However, according to results announced on 20 August, Kabila won 44% of the vote and Bemba won 20%, and therefore the two faced each other in a second round, held on October 29. The electoral commission announced the official results on November 15, naming Kabila the winner with 58.05% of the vote; Bemba\\'s supporters have alleged fraud.\\\\cOn November 27, 2006, the Supreme Court of the DRC rejected the fraud charges brought by the Jean Pierre Bemba, and confirmed Kabila as the new elected Congolese President. A day later, Bemba said that he disagreed with the court\\'s decision, but that \"in the greater national interest and to preserve peace and to save the country from chaos and violence\", he would participate in the system by leading the opposition. He did not attend Kabila\\'s swearing-in ceremony on December 6. On December 8, the MLC announced that Bemba would run for a Senate seat from Kinshasa in the January 2007 senatorial election, and he succeeded in winning a seat.\\\\cA dispute over Bemba\\'s personal guard, which the government seeks to disarm, led to an outbreak of fighting in Kinshasa on March 23, 2007. A number of people, including both soldiers and civilians, were reported killed.

Nine people were killed, including the gunman, 19-year-old former employee Brandon Scott Hole, who committed suicide. Seven others were injured, including four by gunfire. Hole\\'s motive remains unknown.\\nThe FedEx facility where the shooting occurred is located in the southwestern part of the city, near Indianapolis International Airport. It is the company\\'s second-busiest hub, with nearly 4,000 employees in total. The building is equipped with metal detectors and security turnstiles at its entrance requiring the employees to scan their FedEx badges. There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the shooting, and many of them were changing shifts or on dinner breaks.\\nAccording to Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt, the gunman entered the facility in a vehicle and, after exiting unprovoked, immediately began firing. Afterwards, the gunman entered the facility and began shooting again. The shooting lasted several minutes. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene shortly after 11:00\\xa0p.m. local time. However, the shooter took his own life by that point.\\nThe shooting resulted in a brief closure of Interstate 70 at Ameriplex Parkway, which reopened shortly afterwards.\\nThere were nine fatalities in the shooting, including the gunman. Excluding the gunman, four victims were found dead outside of the facility, with the other four being found dead inside. Five people were taken to the hospital, including one in critical condition; four of them suffered gunshot wounds.\\nPolice identified the gunman as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old resident of Indiana who had been employed at the Indianapolis facility until 2020. After the shooting, authorities conducted a search of his home and seized evidence, including electronics.\\nIn March 2020, Hole\\'s mother contacted the FBI and local authorities and warned them about her son\\'s intent to commit suicide by cop, prompting a preliminary investigation to be opened. Hole was placed in a temporary mental health hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. They seized a shotgun from him, and the FBI questioned Hole about unspecified items found in his bedroom in April 2020. Eventually, the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence of any criminal violation, and the shotgun was not returned to Hole. Previously, in 2013, local police contacted Hole for unclear reasons.\\nOn April 16, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff. He and Vice President Kamala Harris released statements expressing their condolences with the victims\\' families. Later, during a press conference with Japanese Prime Minister Yoshihide Suga, he decried the recent string of mass shootings in the United States as a \"national embarrassment\" and called on Congress to act on gun legislation.'"]},"execution_count":254,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 3.38 ms (started: 2022-05-19 07:58:03 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["clusters[4]['update_all_paragraph']"]},{"cell_type":"markdown","metadata":{"id":"W16YMjYxMIxT"},"source":["##### Remove duplicated sentences"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":3566,"status":"ok","timestamp":1652538686890,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"Sk3xGWTqMIf3","outputId":"03c0075b-cfb0-4c46-af1e-634976e0de31"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 3.26 s (started: 2022-05-14 14:31:23 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["train_pt = torch.load('/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS_PRIMER/primer/dataset/wcep-10/wceptrain.pt')\n","# train_pt = torch.load('/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs3_train/filtered/wceptest_train.pt')"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/","height":35},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":398,"status":"ok","timestamp":1652542147252,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"oFtkUVxG-0mJ","outputId":"79b88c10-a80c-4b7c-982c-f518b1ea51ff"},"outputs":[{"data":{"application/vnd.google.colaboratory.intrinsic+json":{"type":"string"},"text/plain":["'/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs2_valid/filtered'"]},"execution_count":422,"metadata":{},"output_type":"execute_result"},{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 3.35 ms (started: 2022-05-14 15:29:06 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["%pwd"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":393,"status":"ok","timestamp":1654192802938,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"GMAUj4Wgks8S","outputId":"5f7ae823-16d0-4d6d-e30c-a35f790b8ec3"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["/content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs1_test/filtered_non\n","time: 10.4 ms (started: 2022-06-02 18:00:02 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["%cd /content/drive/MyDrive/MDS/wcep_custom/bs1_test/filtered_non"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":383,"status":"ok","timestamp":1654192959787,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"fQzxbXuClWSf","outputId":"03e21ec5-da1d-4f3d-c162-84a81fd1b95c"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["aft_model_txt.src       \u001b[0m\u001b[01;34mgen_summ\u001b[0m/                test.txt.tgt\n","aft_test_rouge_txt.src  \u001b[01;34mgen_summ_tuned\u001b[0m/          wceptest_test.pt\n","bef.test.txt.src        output_intermediate.txt  \u001b[01;34mwithout_update_src\u001b[0m/\n","time: 114 ms (started: 2022-06-02 18:02:39 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["%ls"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":2707,"status":"ok","timestamp":1654192815838,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"Mbu1r2ytMFUK","outputId":"02a19ccf-96b2-428b-a98e-a3db87aa7f31"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 1.56 s (started: 2022-06-02 18:00:13 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["src_clusters = []\n","with open(\"bef.test.txt.src\", 'r') as fread:\n","    for line in fread.readlines():\n","        src_clusters.append(line)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"id":"YY97H81bEG-m"},"outputs":[],"source":["### This for further filtering for testing set and validation set (removed duplicated sentences appear in training set)\n","src_clusters = []\n","with open(\"aft_model_txt.src\", 'r') as fread:\n","    for line in fread.readlines():\n","        src_clusters.append(line)"]},{"cell_type":"code","execution_count":null,"metadata":{"colab":{"base_uri":"https://localhost:8080/"},"executionInfo":{"elapsed":6,"status":"ok","timestamp":1652538710245,"user":{"displayName":"Yu-Ting Lee","userId":"13620659935944427506"},"user_tz":-480},"id":"m9qHCQWJMa5g","outputId":"72a56526-a184-4b8b-9dc8-e3e82bcdc0cc"},"outputs":[{"name":"stdout","output_type":"stream","text":["time: 403 ms (started: 2022-05-14 14:31:49 +00:00)\n"]}],"source":["# create sentences for finding duplicated docs -

The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court..\\\\c\\\\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, flew under the radar, adding, This is simply not a big group that we\\\\d ever heard of..\\\\c\\\\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group\\\\s ideology adhered to..\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she also became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May, including one in which armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. President Donald Trump had offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer that woman from Michigan and tweeting on April 17: LIBERATE MICHIGAN!.\\\\c\\\\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4â3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services â and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration â to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public..\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group\\\\s commander. An NBC News investigation into the suspects\\\\ social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material..\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators..\\\\c\\\\cMorrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words Liberty or Death. Morrison\\\\s neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home\\\\s residents were disrespectful and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was Boogaloo Bunyan. Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges..\\\\c\\\\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother\\\\s maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop\\\\s owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group\\\\s meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer\\\\s handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to rage issues and threatening other members on social media..\\\\c\\\\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor\\\\s vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for night fishing as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record..\\\\c\\\\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country\\\\s current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an uprising. However, he also included Trump\\\\s name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder..\\\\c\\\\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts..\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence. The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot..\\\\c\\\\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer\\\\s implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began liking posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers..\\\\c\\\\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled Gretchen Whitmer Interview, depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico\\\\s attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too soft and wouldn\\\\t commit to violence..\\\\c\\\\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house\\\\s yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013..\\\\c\\\\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month..\\\\c\\\\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer\\\\s COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump\\\\s Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook..\\\\c\\\\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar\\\\s former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a very angry person and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar\\\\s father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder..\\\\c\\\\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s home..\\\\c\\\\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. In March 2020, local officers from an unidentified police department in Michigan reported to the FBI that the militia was seeking addresses of officers. The FBI then interviewed a militia member, who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill police officers. On May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft\\\\s Facebook account. Agents found messages plotting potential acts of violence, including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who may be first and was wanted in custody; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster..\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages, was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen\\\\s arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated a violent intent..\\\\c\\\\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer\\\\s address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. The plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how tyrants should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia â already being investigated by the FBI â seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested 200 men to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a trial for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises..\\\\c\\\\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state\\\\s order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a tyrant bitch and stating to viewers, I don\\\\t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do..\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member\\\\s property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico\\\\s defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan\\\\s tactical viability, saying, It\\\\s a fishbowl. Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Musico\\\\s attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico\\\\s eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI\\\\s confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time..\\\\c\\\\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer\\\\s family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor\\\\s office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\\\\m not even fuckin\\\\ kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\\\\t fuckin\\\\ care anymore, I\\\\m just so sick of it. That\\\\s what it\\\\s gonna take for us to take it back, we\\\\re just gonna have to everything\\\\s gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\\\\re gonna topple it all, dude. It\\\\s what great frickin\\\\ conquerors, man, we\\\\re just gonna conquer every fuckin\\\\ thing man. In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out, with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a widespread bombing campaign, according to the FBI..\\\\c\\\\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor\\\\s Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\\\\ Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it\\\\s over. Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer\\\\s exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions..\\\\c\\\\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor\\\\s residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer\\\\s boat. Harris said in a chat, Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself. During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat..\\\\c\\\\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\\\\ home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, We ain\\\\t gonna let \\\\em burn our fuckin\\\\ state down. I don\\\\t give a fuck if there\\\\s only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\\\\ll go out there and use deadly force. The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge near the vacation home to slow and distract police..\\\\c\\\\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor\\\\s Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying perimeter security and other safety upgrades were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer..\\\\c\\\\cWhile driving in three vehiclesâwith an undercover FBI agent and confidential source presentâfrom a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin\\\\s property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely..\\\\c\\\\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin\\\\s property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping. An undercover agent told Fox that explosives for destroying the bridge leading to the lake would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting..\\\\c\\\\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment..\\\\c\\\\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry an automatic sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam\\\\s security staff about the potential threat..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found explosive device components and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and all anti-Americans..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 30, Franks\\\\s attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a violent extremist and saying such a decision would be unreasonable..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors..\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico\\\\s bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial..\\\\c\\\\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client\\\\s plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond..\\\\c\\\\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge..\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters sick and depraved men, and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House. Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump\\\\s rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country..\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot one of the largest cases in recent history and labeled the case as rather unprecedented in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\\\\ original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges disturbing and said, This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police..\\\\c\\\\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of extreme violence and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan\\\\s schools and churches were closed under Whitmer\\\\s orders. In response to Trump\\\\s remarks, Whitmer said it tells you everything you need to know about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump\\\\s remarks on October 16, saying the failure to condemn these folks is stunning..\\\\c\\\\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of Lock her up!, to which he replied, Lock \\\\em all up. Trump\\\\s daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely having fun at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC\\\\s Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump\\\\s rhetoric incredibly disturbing and said it is inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism. She also countered Trump\\\\s claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\\\\t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of Lock her up!..\\\\c\\\\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response..\\\\c\\\\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it\\\\s a felony, make a felony arrest. Citing the state\\\\s citizen\\\\s arrest statute, he continued, It doesn\\\\t say if you are an elected office that you\\\\re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\\\\m hoping that\\\\s more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\\\\m not even sure if they had any part of it..\\\\c\\\\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as dangerous, while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen\\\\s arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called horrible. His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign..\\\\c\\\\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan\\\\s electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\\\\ offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following credible threats of violence. The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a Hail Mary effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, No. I don\\\\t know. Because what we\\\\re doing today is uncharted. Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17..\\\\c\\\\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer\\\\s kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI\\\\s investigation..\\\\c\\\\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired..\\\\c\\\\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\\\\ actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen\\\\s actions..\\\\c\\\\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as Mostly False..\\\\c\\\\cA judge lifts the curfew and house arrest restrictions of two brothers who are suspected of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer last year. However, they are still required to wear GPS tethers.\\n',\n"," 'Brexit (/ËbrÉksÉªt, ËbrÉÉ¡zÉªt/; a portmanteau of British exit) was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) at the end of 31 January 2020 CET. The UK is the first and only country formally to leave the EU, after 47 years of having been a member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Communities (EC), since 1 January 1973. It continued to participate in the European Union Customs Union and European Single Market during a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET)..\\\\c\\\\cThe European Union and its institutions have developed gradually since their establishment, including 47 years of British membership, and grew to be of significant importance to the UK. Throughout that time Eurosceptic groups had existed, opposing aspects of the Union and its predecessors. Prime Minister Harold Wilsonâs pro-Europe government held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975 in which voters chose to stay within the bloc with 67.2% of the vote share, but no further referendums were held as the project grew and became ever-closer in the subsequent Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. Facing pressure from Eurosceptic groups, Prime Minister David Cameron\\\\s pro-Europe government held a second referendum on continued EU membership in 2016 in which voters chose to leave the EU with 51.9% of the vote share. This led to his resignation, replacement by Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and future relations. This process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, with one deal rejected by the British parliament, general elections held in 2017 and 2019, and two new Prime Ministers in that time, both Conservative. Under Boris Johnson\\\\s government, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 CET; trade deal negotiations continued to within days of the scheduled end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 CET..\\\\c\\\\cThe effects of Brexit will in part be determined by the EUâUK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was agreed on 24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK Parliament on 30 December 2020 and was provisionally applied by the EU from 31 December 2020. The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK\\\\s economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for British higher education, academic research and security; the Turing scheme was announced as a new global student exchange programme in early 2021 to combat this. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over British laws or its Supreme Court. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, in which 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48.11% voted to remain a member, Prime Minister David Cameron resigned. On 29 March 2017, the new British Government led by Theresa May formally notified the EU of the country\\\\s intention to withdraw, beginning the Brexit process. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for 29 March 2019. It was delayed by deadlock in the British Parliament after the June 2017 general election, which resulted in a hung parliament in which the Conservatives lost their majority but remained the largest party. This deadlock led to three extensions of the Article 50 process..\\\\c\\\\cThe deadlock was resolved after a subsequent general election was held in December 2019. In that election, Conservatives who campaigned in support of a revised withdrawal agreement led by Boris Johnson won an overall majority of 80 seats. After the December 2019 election, the British Parliament finally ratified the withdrawal agreement. The UK left the EU at the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11 p.m. This began a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 CET (11 p.m. GMT), during which the UK and EU negotiated their future relationship. During the transition, the UK remained subject to EU law and remained part of the EU customs union and single market. However, it was no longer part of the EU\\\\s political bodies or institutions..\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal was advocated by hard Eurosceptics and opposed by pro-Europeanists and soft Eurosceptics, with both sides of the argument spanning the political spectrum. The UK joined the European Communities (EC) â principally the European Economic Community (EEC) â in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in the 1975 referendum. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the Labour Party\\\\s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty founded the EU, was ratified by the British Parliament in 1993 but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party led a rebellion over ratification of the treaty and, with the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the cross-party People\\\\s Pledge campaign then led a collective campaign particularly after the Treaty of Lisbon was also ratified by the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 without being put to a referendum following a previous promise to hold a referendum on ratifying the abandoned European Constitution was never held eventually pressured the Conservative prime minister David Cameron to hold the June 2016 membership referendum. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by Theresa May..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 March 2017, the British government formally began the withdrawal process by invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union with permission from Parliament. May called a snap general election in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government supported by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). UKâEU withdrawal negotiations began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 withdrawal agreement, but the British parliament voted against ratifying it three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement\\\\s financial settlement, as well as the Irish backstop designed to prevent border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a proposed second referendum..\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 March 2019, the British Parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until June, and then later October. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by Boris Johnson. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. On 17 October 2019, the British Government and the EU agreed on a revised withdrawal agreement, with new arrangements for Northern Ireland. Parliament approved the agreement for further scrutiny, but rejected passing it into law before the 31 October deadline, and forced the government (through the Benn Act) to ask for a third Brexit delay. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020. The withdrawal agreement was ratified by the UK on 23 January and by the EU on 30 January; it came into force on 31 January 2020..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the referendum of 23 June 2016, many new pieces of Brexit-related jargon entered popular use..\\\\c\\\\cThe Inner Six European countries signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951, establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The 1955 Messina Conference deemed that the ECSC was a success, and resolved to extend the concept further, thereby leading to the 1957 Treaties of Rome establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). In 1967, these became known as the European Communities (EC). The UK attempted to join in 1963 and 1967, but these applications were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle..\\\\c\\\\cSome time after de Gaulle resigned in 1969, the UK successfully applied for EC membership, and the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972. Parliament passed the European Communities Act later that year and the UK joined Denmark and Ireland in becoming a member on 1 January 1973..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party was the more Eurosceptic of the two major parties, and the Conservatives the more Europhile. The 1983 Labour Party manifesto would even pledge to leave the then European Economic Community. Earlier on, Labour had won the February 1974 general election without a majority and then contested the subsequent October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain\\\\s terms of membership of the EC, believing them to be unfavourable, and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EC on the new terms. Labour again won the election (this time with a small majority), and in 1975 the UK held its first ever national referendum, asking whether the UK should remain in the EC. Despite significant division within the ruling Labour Party, all major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. On 5 June 1975, 67.2% of the electorate and all but two British counties and regions voted to stay in; support for the UK to leave the EC in 1975 appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum..\\\\c\\\\cThe Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EC without a referendum. After their heavy defeat in that election, Labour changed its policy. In 1985, the second Margaret Thatcher government ratified the Single European Actâthe first major revision to the Treaty of Romeâwithout a referendum.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cIn October 1990, under pressure from senior ministers and despite Thatcher\\\\s deep reservations, the UK joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the pound sterling pegged to the deutschmark. Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister the following month, amid Conservative Party divisions arising partly from her increasingly Eurosceptic views. The UK and Italy were forced to withdraw from the ERM in September 1992, after the pound sterling and the lira came under pressure from currency speculation (Black Wednesday)..\\\\c\\\\cUnder the Maastricht Treaty, the EC became the EU on 1 November 1993, reflecting the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political one. Denmark, France, and Ireland held referendums to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. In accordance with Constitution of the United Kingdom, specifically that of parliamentary sovereignty, ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian Vernon Bogdanor wrote that there was a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK\\\\s previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had no way to express it. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimateâwhich requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain\\\\s relationship with the [EC]. This perceived democratic deficit directly led to the formation of the Referendum Party and the UK Independence Party.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cThatcher, who had previously supported the common market and the Single European Act, in the Bruges speech of 1988 warned against a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. She influenced Daniel Hannan, who in 1990 founded the Oxford Campaign for Independent Britain; With hindsight, some see this as the start of the campaign for Brexit, the Financial Times later wrote. In 1994, Sir James Goldsmith formed the Referendum Party to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the nature of the UK\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. The party fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election, and won 810,860 votesâ2.6% of the total votes castâbut failed to win a parliamentary seat because the vote was spread across the country. The Referendum Party disbanded after Goldsmith\\\\s death in 1997.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cThe UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was formed in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than Labour or the Conservatives had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election. UKIP\\\\s electoral success in the 2014 European election is documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum..\\\\c\\\\cUKIP won two by-elections (triggered by defecting Conservative MPs) in 2014; in the 2015 general election, the party took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014..\\\\c\\\\cBoth pro- and anti-EU views had majority support at different times from 1977 to 2015. In the EC membership referendum of 1975, two-thirds of British voters favoured continued EC membership. Over the decades of UK-EU membership, Euroscepticism existed on both the left and right of British politics..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to a statistical analysis published in April 2016 by Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, surveys showed an increase in Euroscepticism (defined as a wish to sever or reduce the powers of the EU) from 38% in 1993 to 65% in 2015. The BSA survey for the period of JulyâNovember 2015 showed that 60% backed the option to continue as a member and 30% backed withdrawal..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron initially rejected calls for a referendum on the UK\\\\s EU membership, but then suggested the possibility of a future referendum to endorse his proposed renegotiation of Britain\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. According to the BBC, The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK\\\\s [renegotiated] position within the [EU] had \\\\the full-hearted support of the British people\\\\ but they needed to show \\\\tactical and strategic patience\\\\. On 23 January 2013, under pressure from many of his MPs and from the rise of UKIP, Cameron promised in his Bloomberg speech that a Conservative government would hold an in-or-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in the 7 May 2015 general election. This was included in the Conservative Party manifesto for the election..\\\\c\\\\cThe Conservative Party won the election with a majority. Soon afterwards, the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Cameron favoured remaining in a reformed EU, and sought to renegotiate on four key points: protection of the single market for non-eurozone countries, reduction of red tape, exempting Britain from ever-closer union, and restricting immigration from the rest of the EU..\\\\c\\\\cIn December 2015, opinion polls showed a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU; they also showed support would drop if Cameron did not negotiate adequate safeguards[definition needed] for non-eurozone member states, and restrictions on benefits for non-UK EU citizens..\\\\c\\\\cThe outcome of the renegotiations was revealed in February 2016. Some limits to in-work benefits for new EU immigrants were agreed, but before they could be applied, a member state such as the UK would have to get permission from the European Commission and then from the European Council, which is composed of the heads of government of every member state..\\\\c\\\\cIn a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016, and commented on the renegotiation settlement. He spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a Leave vote and of the two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the original wording for the referendum question was challenged, the government agreed to change the official referendum question to Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?.\\\\c\\\\cIn the referendum 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU (Leave), and 48.11% voted in favour of remaining a member of the EU (Remain). After this result, Cameron resigned on 13 July 2016, with Theresa May becoming Prime Minister after a leadership contest. A petition calling for a second referendum attracted more than four million signatures, but was rejected by the government on 9 July..\\\\c\\\\cA 2017 study published in Economic Policy showed that the Leave vote tended to be greater in areas which had lower incomes and high unemployment, a strong tradition of manufacturing employment, and in which the population had fewer qualifications. It also tended to be greater where there was a large flow of Eastern European migrants (mainly low-skilled workers) into areas with a large share of native low-skilled workers. Those in lower social grades (especially the working class) were more likely to vote Leave, while those in higher social grades (especially the upper middle class) more likely to vote Remain. Studies found that the Leave vote tended to be higher in areas affected by economic decline, high rates of suicides and drug-related deaths, and austerity reforms introduced in 2010..\\\\c\\\\cStudies suggest that older people were more likely to vote Leave, and younger people more likely to vote Remain. According to Thomas Sampson, an economist at the London School of Economics, Older and less-educated voters were more likely to vote \\\\leave\\\\ [...] A majority of white voters wanted to leave, but only 33% of Asian voters and 27% of black voters chose leave. There was no gender split in the vote [...] Leaving the European Union received support from across the political spectrum [...] Voting to leave the European Union was strongly associated with holding socially conservative political beliefs, opposing cosmopolitanism, and thinking life in Britain is getting worse..\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polls found that Leave voters believed leaving the EU was more likely to bring about a better immigration system, improved border controls, a fairer welfare system, better quality of life, and the ability to control our own laws, while Remain voters believed EU membership would be better for the economy, international investment, and the UK\\\\s influence in the world. Polls found that the main reasons people voted Leave were the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK, and that leaving offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders. The main reason people voted Remain was that the risks of voting to leave the EU looked too great when it came to things like the economy, jobs and prices..\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal from the European Union is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. It was originally drafted by Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, and introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon at the insistence of the United Kingdom.[citation needed] The article states that any member state can withdraw in accordance with its own constitutional requirements by notifying the European Council of its intention to do so. The notification triggers a two-year negotiation period, in which the EU must negotiate and conclude an agreement with [the leaving] State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the [European] Union. If no agreement is reached within the two years, the membership ends without an agreement, unless an extension is unanimously agreed among all EU states, including the withdrawing state. On the EU side, the agreement needs to be ratified by qualified majority in the European Council, and by the European Parliament..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2015 Referendum Act did not expressly require Article 50 to be invoked, but prior to the referendum, the British government said it would respect the result. When Cameron resigned following the referendum, he said that it would be for the incoming prime minister to invoke Article 50. The new prime minister, Theresa May, said she would wait until 2017 to invoke the article, in order to prepare for the negotiations. In October 2016, she said Britain would trigger Article 50 in March 2017, and in December she gained the support of MP\\\\s for her timetable..\\\\c\\\\cIn January 2017, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled in the Miller case that government could only invoke Article 50 if authorised by an act of parliament to do so. The government subsequently introduced a bill for that purpose, and it was passed into law on 16 March as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. On 29 March, Theresa May triggered Article 50 when Tim Barrow, the British ambassador to the EU, delivered the invocation letter to European Council President Donald Tusk. This made 29 March 2019 the expected date that UK would leave EU..\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2017, Theresa May called a snap general election, held on 8 June, in an attempt to strengthen [her] hand in the negotiations; The Conservative Party, Labour and UKIP made manifesto pledges to implement the referendum, the Labour manifesto differing in its approach to Brexit negotiations, such as unilaterally offering permanent residence to EU immigrants. The Liberal Democrat Party and the Green Party manifestos proposed a policy of remaining in the EU via a second referendum. The Scottish National Party (SNP) manifesto proposed a policy of waiting for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and then holding a referendum on Scottish independence..\\\\c\\\\cThe result produced an unexpected hung parliament, the governing Conservatives gained votes (but nevertheless lost seats and their majority in the House of Commons) but remained the largest party. Labour gained significantly on votes and seats, retaining its position as the second-largest party. The Liberal Democrats gained six seats despite a slight decrease in vote share compared with 2015. The Green Party kept its single MP while also losing national vote share. Losing votes and seats were the SNP, which lost 21 MPs, and UKIP, which suffered a -10.8% swing and lost its only MP. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FeÌin also made gains in votes and seats..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 June 2017, Conservatives and the DUP reached a confidence and supply agreement whereby the DUP would back the Conservatives in key votes in the House of Commons over the course of the parliament. The agreement included additional funding of Â£1 billion for Northern Ireland, highlighted mutual support for Brexit and national security, expressed commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and indicated that policies such as the state pension triple lock and Winter Fuel Payments would be maintained..\\\\c\\\\cPrior to the negotiations, May said that the British government would not seek permanent single market membership, would end ECJ jurisdiction, seek a new trade agreement, end free movement of people and maintain the Common Travel Area with Ireland. The EU had adopted its negotiating directives in May, and appointed Michel Barnier as Chief Negotiator. The EU wished to perform the negotiations in two phases:  first the UK would agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, and then negotiations on a future relationship could begin. In the first phase, the member states would demand that the UK pay a divorce bill, initially estimated as amounting to Â£52 billion. EU negotiators said that an agreement must be reached between UK and the EU by October 2018..\\\\c\\\\cNegotiations commenced on 19 June 2017. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa; Britain\\\\s outstanding financial obligations to the EU; and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In December 2017, a partial agreement was reached. It ensured that there would be no hard border in Ireland, protected the rights of UK citizens in EU and EU citizens in Britain, and estimated the financial settlement to be Â£35â39 billion. May stressed that Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Following this partial agreement, EU leaders agreed to move on to the second phase in the negotiations:  discussion of the future relationship, a transition period and a possible trade deal..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2018, a 21-month transition period and the terms for it were provisionally agreed. In June 2018, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that there had been little progress on the Irish border questionâon which the EU proposed a backstop, to come into effect if no overall trade deal had been reached by the end of the transition periodâand that it was unlikely that there would be a solution before October, when the whole deal was to be agreed. In July 2018, the British government published the Chequers plan, its aims for the future relationship to be determined in the negotiations. The plan sought to keep British access to the single market for goods, but not necessarily for services, while allowing for an independent trade policy. The plan caused cabinet resignations, including Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson..\\\\c\\\\cOn 13 November 2018, UK and EU negotiators agreed the text of a draft withdrawal agreement, and May secured her cabinet\\\\s backing of the deal the following day, though Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned over fatal flaws in the agreement. It was expected that ratification in the British parliament would be difficult. On 25 November, all 27 leaders of the remaining EU countries endorsed the agreement..\\\\c\\\\cOn 10 December 2018, the Prime Minister postponed the vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal. This came minutes after the Prime Minister\\\\s Office confirmed the vote would be going ahead. Faced with the prospect of a defeat in the House of Commons, this option gave May more time to negotiate with Conservative backbenchers and the EU, even though they had ruled out further discussions. The decision was met with calls from many Welsh Labour MPs for a motion of no confidence in the Government..\\\\c\\\\cAlso on 10 December 2018, the European Court of Justice(ECJ) ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its notification of withdrawal, as long as it was still a member and had not agreed a withdrawal agreement. The decision to do so should be unequivocal and unconditional and follow a democratic process.If the British revoked their notification, they would remain a member of the EU under their current membership terms. The case was launched by Scottish politicians, and referred to the ECJ by the Scottish Court of Session..\\\\c\\\\cThe European Research Group (ERG), a staunchly anti-EU grouping in Conservative Party, opposed the Prime Minister\\\\s proposed Withdrawal Agreement treaty. Its members objected strongly to the Withdrawal Agreement\\\\s inclusion of the Irish backstop. ERG members also objected to the proposed Â£39 billion financial settlement with the EU and stated that the agreement would result in the UK\\\\s agreement to continuing to follow EU regulations in major policy areas; and to the continuing jurisdiction of the ECJ over interpretation of the agreement and of European law still applicable to the UK..\\\\c\\\\cOn 15 January 2019, the House of Commons voted 432 to 202 against the deal, which was the largest majority ever against a United Kingdom government. Soon after, a motion of no confidence in Her Majesty\\\\s Government was tabled by the opposition, which was rejected by 325 votes to 306..\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 February, Prime Minister May proposed that the next vote on the withdrawal agreement would be on 12 March 2019, 17 days away from the Brexit date. On 12 March, the proposal was defeated by 391 votes to 242âa loss by 149 votes, down from 230 from when the deal had been proposed in January..\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 March 2019, the Speaker informed the House of Commons that a third meaningful vote could be held only on a motion that was significantly different from the previous one, citing parliamentary precedents going back to 1604..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement was brought back to the House without the attached understandings on 29 March. The Government\\\\s motion of support for the Withdrawal Agreement was defeated by 344 votes to 286âa loss by 58 votes, down from 149 when the deal had been proposed on 12 March..\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 March 2019, the Prime Minister wrote to European Council President Tusk requesting that Brexit be postponed until 30 June 2019. On 21 March 2019, May presented her case to a European Council summit meeting in Brussels. After May left the meeting, a discussion amongst the remaining EU leaders resulted in the rejection of 30 June date and offered instead a choice of two new alternative Brexit dates. On 22 March 2019, the extension options were agreed between the British government and the European Council. The first alternative offered was that if MPs rejected May\\\\s deal in the next week, Brexit would be due to occur by 12 April 2019, with, or without, a dealâor alternatively another extension be asked for and a commitment to participate in the 2019 European Parliament elections given. The second alternative offered was that if MPs approved May\\\\s deal, Brexit would be due to occur on 22 May 2019. The later date was the day before the start of European Parliament elections. After the government deemed unwarranted the concerns over the legality of the proposed change (because it contained two possible exit dates) the previous day, on 27 March 2019 both the Lords (without a vote) and the Commons (by 441 to 105) approved the statutory instrument changing the exit date to 22 May 2019 if a withdrawal deal is approved, or 12 April 2019 if it is not. The amendment was then signed into law at 12:40 p.m. the next day..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the failure of the British Parliament to approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March, the UK was required to leave the EU on 12 April 2019. On 10 April 2019, late-night talks in Brussels resulted in a further extension, to 31 October 2019; Theresa May had again requested an extension only until 30 June. Under the terms of this new extension, if the Withdrawal Agreement were to be passed before October, Brexit would occur on the first day of the subsequent month. The UK would then be obligated to hold European Parliament elections in May, or leave the EU on 1 June without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cIn granting the Article 50 extensions, the EU adopted a stance of refusing to reopen (that is, renegotiate) the Withdrawal Agreement..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Boris Johnson became prime minister on 24 July 2019 and met with EU leaders, the EU changed its stance. On 17 October 2019, following tunnel talks between UK and EU, a revised withdrawal agreement was agreed on negotiators level, and endorsed by the British government and the EU Commission. The revised deal contained a new Northern Ireland Protocol, as well as technical modifications to related articles. In addition, the Political Declaration was also revised. The revised deal and the political declaration was endorsed by the European Council later that day. To come into effect, it needed to be ratified by the European Parliament and the Parliament of the United Kingdom..\\\\c\\\\cThe British Parliament passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, which received Royal Assent on 9 September 2019, obliging the Prime Minister to seek a third extension if no agreement has been reached at the next European Council meeting in October 2019. In order for such an extension to be granted if it is requested by the Prime Minister, it would be necessary for there to be unanimous agreement by all other heads of EU governments. On 28 October 2019, the third extension was agreed to by the EU, with a new withdrawal deadline of 31 January 2020. \\\\Exit day\\\\ in British law was then amended to this new date by statutory instrument on 30 October 2019..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Johnson was unable to induce Parliament to approve a revised version of the withdrawal agreement by the end of October, he chose to call for a snap election. The House of Commons supported the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 by 438â20, setting the election date for Thursday 12 December. Opinion polls up to polling day showed a firm lead for the Conservatives against Labour throughout the campaign..\\\\c\\\\cIn the run-up to the general election on 12 December 2019 the Conservative Party pledged to leave the EU with the withdrawal agreement negotiated in October 2019. Labour promised to renegotiate aforementioned deal and hold a referendum, letting voters choose between the renegotiated deal and remain. The Liberal Democrats vowed to revoke Article 50, while the SNP intended to hold a second referendum, however, revoking Article 50 if the alternative was a no-deal exit. The DUP supported Brexit, but would seek to change parts related to Northern Ireland it was dissatisfied with. Plaid Cymru and the Green Party backed a second referendum, believing the UK should stay in the EU. The Brexit Party was the only major party running for election which wanted the UK to leave the EU without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cThe election produced a decisive result for Boris Johnson with the Conservatives winning 365 seats (gaining 47 seats) and a overall majority of 80 seats with Labour suffering their worst election defeat since 1935 after losing 60 seats to leave them with 202 seats and only a single seat in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats won just 11 seats with their leader Jo Swinson losing her own seat. The Scottish National Party won 48 seats after gaining 14 seats in Scotland..\\\\c\\\\cThe result broke the deadlock in the British Parliament and ended the possibility of a referendum being held on the withdrawal agreement and ensured that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on 31 January 2020..\\\\c\\\\cSubsequently, the government introduced a bill to ratify the withdrawal agreement. It passed its second reading in the House of Commons in a 358â234 vote on 20 December 2019, and became law on 23 January 2020.\\\\c\\\\cas the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020..\\\\c\\\\cThe withdrawal agreement received the backing of the constitutional committee in the European Parliament on 23 January 2020, setting expectation that the entire parliament would approve it in a later vote. On the following day, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel signed the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, and it was sent to London where Boris Johnson signed it. The European Parliament gave its consent to ratification on 29 January by 621 votes to 49. Immediately after voting approval, members of the European Parliament joined hands and sang Auld Lang Syne. The Council of the European Union concluded EU ratification the following day..\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 January 2020 at 11 p.m. GMT, the United Kingdom\\\\s membership of the European Union ended 47 years after it joined..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the British exit on 31 January 2020 the UK entered a Transition Period. Trade, travel and freedom of movement remain largely unchanged during this period. The transition period ended at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET) on 31 December 2020..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement still applies after this date. This agreement provides free access of goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, provided checks are made to goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The British Government attempted to back out of this commitment by passing the Internal Market Bill: domestic legislation in the British Parliament. In September, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said:.\\\\c\\\\cleading to the resignation of Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department and Lord Keen, the law officer for Scotland. The EU started legal action..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the transition period, David Frost and Michel Barnier continued to negotiate a permanent trade agreement. On 24 December 2020 both parties announced that a deal had been reached. The deal was passed by both houses of the British parliament on 30 December and given Royal Assent in the early hours of the next day. The transition period concluded under its terms the following evening. After the UK said it would unilaterally extend a grace period limiting checks on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the European Parliament postponed setting a date to ratify the agreement..\\\\c\\\\cIn October 2016, Theresa May promised a Great Repeal Bill, which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in British law all enactments previously in force under EU law. Subsequently renamed the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, it was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017..\\\\c\\\\cOn 12 September 2017, the bill passed its first vote and second reading by a margin of 326 votes to 290 votes in the House of Commons. The bill was further amended on a series of votes in both Houses. After the Act became law on 26 June 2018, the European Council decided on 29 June to renew its call on Member States and European Union institutions to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act fixed the period ending 21 January 2019 for the government to decide on how to proceed if the negotiations had not reached agreement in principle on both the withdrawal arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and EU; while, alternatively, making future ratification of the withdrawal agreement as a treaty between the UK and EU depend upon the prior enactment of another act of Parliament for approving the final terms of withdrawal when the Brexit negotiations were completed. In any event, the act did not alter the two-year period for negotiating allowed by Article 50 that ended at the latest on 29 March 2019 if the UK had not by then ratified a withdrawal agreement or agreed a prolongation of the negotiating period..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act which became law in June 2018 allowed for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. It authorises the government to bring into force, by order made under section 25, the provisions that fixed exit day and the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972, but exit day must be the same day and time as when the EU Treaties ceased to apply to the UK..\\\\c\\\\cExit day was the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11.00 p.m. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by a British Statutory Instrument on 11 April 2019), in section 20 (1), defined \\\\exit day\\\\ as 11:00 p.m. on 31 October 2019. Originally, \\\\exit day\\\\ was defined as 11:00 p.m. on 29 March 2019 GMT (UTC+0)..\\\\c\\\\cA report published in March 2017 by the Institute for Government commented that, in addition to the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, primary and secondary legislation will be needed to cover the gaps in policy areas such as customs, immigration and agriculture. The report also commented that the role of the devolved legislatures was unclear, and could cause problems, and as many as 15 new additional Brexit Bills may be required, which would involve strict prioritisation and limiting Parliamentary time for in-depth examination of new legislation..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2016 and 2017, the House of Lords published a series of reports on Brexit-related subjects, including:.\\\\c\\\\cThe Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018, relating to withdrawal from Euratom, was presented to Parliament in October 2017. The act makes provision about nuclear safeguards, and for connected.\\\\c\\\\cpurposes. The Secretary of State may by regulations (nuclear safeguards regulations) make provision for the purpose of â (a) ensuring that qualifying nuclear material, facilities or.\\\\c\\\\cequipment are available only for use for civil activities (whether in the UK or elsewhere), or (b) giving effect to provisions of a relevant international agreement..\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling overall showed an initial fall in support for Brexit from the referendum to late 2016, when responses were split evenly between support and opposition. Support rose again to a plurality, which held until the 2017 general election. Since then, opinion polls tended to show a plurality of support for remaining in the EU or for the view that Brexit was a mistake, with the estimated margin increasing until a small decrease in 2019 (to 53% Remain : 47% Leave, as of October 2019[update]). This seems to be largely due to a preference for remaining in the EU among those who did not vote in 2016\\\\s referendum (an estimated 2.5 million of whom, as of October 2019[update], were too young to vote at the time). Other reasons suggested include slightly more Leave voters than Remain voters (14% and 12% of each, respectively, as of October 2019[update]) changing how they would vote (particularly in Labour areas) and the deaths of older voters, most of whom voted to leave the EU..\\\\c\\\\cOne estimate of demographic changes (ignoring other effects) implies that had an EU referendum taken place in October 2019,[update] there would have been between 800,000 and 900,000 fewer Leave voters and between 600,000 and 700,000 more Remain voters, resulting in a Remain majority..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2019, a petition submitted to the British Parliament petitions website, calling on the government to revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU, reached a record-level of more than 6.1 million signatures..\\\\c\\\\cPost-referendum opinion polling.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK was right or wrong to vote to leave the EU.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, including Neither responses.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, excluding Neither responses and normalised.\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Brexit referendum, the Scottish Government â led by the Scottish National Party (SNP) â planned another independence referendum because Scotland voted to remain in the EU while England and Wales voted to leave. It had suggested this before the Brexit referendum. The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, requested a referendum be held before the UK\\\\s withdrawal, but the British Prime Minister rejected this timing. The Scottish Parliament voted in favour of holding another independence referendum, with Sturgeon planning it for 2021. At the referendum in 2014, 55% of voters had decided to remain in the UK, but the referendum on Britain\\\\s withdrawal from the EU was held in 2016, with 62% of Scottish voters against it. In the event that Northern Ireland remains associated with the EU â for example, by remaining in the Customs Union â it is expected that Scotland will also insist on special treatment..\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 March 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Scottish Continuity Bill. This was passed by stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court\\\\s judgement, designated itself under Schedule 4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament. The bill has therefore not received royal assent..\\\\c\\\\cOn 19 December 2018, the EU Commission revealed its no-deal Contingency Action Plan in specific sectors, in respect of the UK leaving the EU in 100 days\\\\ time..\\\\c\\\\cIn the wake of the United Kingdom\\\\s vote to leave the European Union, the Department for International Trade (DIT) for reaching and extending trade agreements between the UK and non-EU states was created by Prime Minister May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016. By 2017, it employed about 200 trade negotiators and was overseen by then Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox. In March 2019, the British government announced that it would cut many import tariffs to zero, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Confederation of British Industry said the move would be a sledgehammer for our economy, and the National Farmer\\\\s Union was also highly critical. Additionally, the plan appeared to breach standard WTO rules..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 June 2020, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel stated that the European Union must prepare for the possible failure of Brexit trade talks with the UK. She added that negotiations were being accelerated to try and reach a deal that could be ratified by the end of the year. Her warning came as the deadline for extending talks passed away, with negotiations expected to end on 31 December with or without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cThere has been litigation to explore the constitutional footings on which Brexit stands after R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (simply known as the Miller case) and the 2017 Notification Act:.\\\\c\\\\cIn R. (Webster) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, a Divisional Court of Gross LJ and Green MR determined that the substantive decision to leave the EU that was notified on 29 March 2017 was in fact the executive decision of the Prime Minister using a statutory power of decision found to have been delegated to her by the Notification Act: this is confirmed by the House of Commons Library commentary on the case. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal and paragraph 15 of the judgement, along with the citable nature of the decision were upheld.  While the case was criticised academically by Robert Craig, who lectures in jurisprudence at the London School of Economics, aspects of the case\\\\s analysis were supported by the Supreme Court in Miller 2 at paragraph 57, which confirmed that:.\\\\c\\\\cThis confirmation that the decision was an executive act was part of the basis of R. (Wilson) v. Prime Minister which allied this point with the concerns about the irregularities in the referendum.  The High Court hearing was on 7 December 2018 before Ouseley MJ and when judgement was given it was held that: courtsâ job was not to rule on irregularities in the âleaveâ campaign as these were not questions of law; it was also said that the case was brought both too early and too late. Judgement in the Court of Appeal (before Hickinbottom LJ and Haddon-Cave LJ) before also went against the applicant..\\\\c\\\\cRegarding the reversibility of a notification under Article 50, Wightman and others v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union was referred to Court of Justice of the European Union; the UK government sought to block this referral, taking the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court, but was unsuccessful. On 10 December 2018, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notification..\\\\c\\\\cMany effects of Brexit depended on whether the UK left with a withdrawal agreement, or before an agreement was ratified (no-deal Brexit). In 2017, the Financial Times said that there were approximately 759 international agreements, spanning 168 non-EU countries, that the UK would no longer be a party to upon leaving the EU..\\\\c\\\\cEconomists expect that Brexit will have damaging immediate and longer term effects on the economies of the UK and at least part of the EU27. In particular, there is a broad consensus among economists and in the economic literature that Brexit will likely reduce the UK\\\\s real per capita income in the medium and long term, and that the Brexit referendum itself damaged the economy. Studies found that Brexit-induced uncertainty reduced British GDP, British national income, investment by business, employment and British international trade from June 2016 onwards..\\\\c\\\\cA 2019 analysis found that British firms substantially increased offshoring to the EU after the Brexit referendum, whereas European firms reduced new investments in the UK. The British government\\\\s own Brexit analysis, leaked in January 2018, showed that British economic growth would be stunted by 2â8% over the 15 years following Brexit, the amount depending on the leave scenario. Economists warned that London\\\\s future as an international financial centre depended on passport agreements with the EU. Pro-Brexit activists and politicians have argued for negotiating trade and migration agreements with the CANZUK countriesâthose of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdomâbut economists have said that trade deals with those countries would be far less valuable to the UK than EU membership. Studies project that Brexit will exacerbate regional economic inequality in the UK, by hitting already-struggling regions the hardest..\\\\c\\\\cThe potential impact on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been a contentious issue. Since 2005, the border has been essentially invisible. After Brexit, it became the only UKâEU land border  (not counting the land border between the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar with Spain). All involved parties agree a hard border should be avoided, as it might compromise the Good Friday Agreement that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. To forestall this, the EU proposed a backstop agreement (the Northern Ireland Protocol) that would have kept the UK in the Customs Union and kept Northern Ireland in some aspects of the Single Market also, until a lasting solution was found. The backstop was part of the withdrawal agreement, but was replaced in the revised agreement..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit caused the European Union to lose its second-largest economy, its third-most populous country, and the second-largest net contributor to the EU budget. Brexit will result in an additional financial burden for the remaining net contributors, unless the budget is reduced accordingly. The UK will no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, where it has 16% of the shares. Analyses indicate that the departure of the relatively economically liberal UK will reduce the ability of remaining economically liberal countries to block measures in the Council of the EU. In 2019, ahead of Brexit, the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority moved their headquarters from London to Amsterdam and Paris, respectively..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which provides government financial support to farmers in the EU. The UK receives much less than it contributes. Brexit allows the UK to develop its own agriculture policy. The current UK government has committed to maintaining the same payments to farmers until the end of the current parliament, even without a withdrawal agreement. The Agriculture Bill is intended to replace the CAP with a new system. The UK will also leave the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) that lets all EU countries fish within 12 nautical miles of the British coast and lets the EU set catch quotas. The combined EU fishing fleets land about six million tonnes of fish per year, about half of which are from British waters. By leaving the CFP, the UK could develop its own fisheries policy. The UK will also leave the London Fisheries Convention that lets Irish, French, Belgian, Dutch and German vessels fish within six nautical miles of the UK\\\\s coast..\\\\c\\\\cGibraltar, a British Overseas Territory bordering Spain, will be affected by Brexit. Spain asserts a territorial claim on Gibraltar. After the referendum, Spain\\\\s Foreign Minister renewed calls for joint SpanishâBritish control. In late 2018, the British and Spanish governments agreed that any dispute over Gibraltar would not affect Brexit negotiations, and the British government agreed that UKâEU treaties made after Brexit would not automatically apply to Gibraltar..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit poses challenges to British academia and research, as the UK is likely to lose research funding from EU sources; see a reduction in students from the EU; find it harder to hire researchers from the EU; and British students will find it harder to study abroad in the EU. The UK is currently a member of the European Research Area and likely to wish to remain an associated member following Brexit. The British government has guaranteed funding for research currently funded by EU..\\\\c\\\\cAn early 2019 study found that Brexit would deplete the National Health Service (NHS) workforce, create uncertainties regarding care for British nationals living in the EU, and put at risk access to vaccines, equipment, and medicines. The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has taken steps to ensure the continuity of medical supplies after Brexit.  The number of non-British EU nurses registering with the NHS fell from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April 2017..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will have the final say over the laws that govern it. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, EU laws will no longer have supremacy over British laws after Brexit. To maintain continuity, the Act converts EU law into British law as retained EU law. After Brexit, the British parliament (and the devolved legislatures) can decide which elements of that law to keep, amend or repeal. Furthermore, British courts will no longer be bound by the judgments of the EU Court of Justice after Brexit..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK would be able to control immigration from the EU and EEA, as it can end EU freedom of movement. The current British government intends to replace it with a new system. The government\\\\s 2018 white paper proposes a skills-based immigration system that prioritizes skilled migrants. EU and EEA citizens already living in the UK can continue living there after Brexit by applying to the EU Settlement Scheme, which began in March 2019. Irish citizens will not have to apply to the scheme. Studies estimate that Brexit and the end of free movement will likely result in a large decline in immigration from EEA countries to the UK. After Brexit, any foreigner wanting to do so more than temporarily would need a work permit..\\\\c\\\\cBy leaving the EU, the UK would leave the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA), a single market in commercial air travel, but could negotiate a number of different future relationships with the EU. British airlines would still have permission to operate within the EU with no restrictions, and vice versa. The British government seeks continued participation in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The UK has its own air service agreements with 111 countries, which permit flights to-and-from the country, and further 17 countries through its EU membership. These have since been replaced. Ferries will continue, but with obstacles such as customs checks. New ferry departures between the Republic of Ireland and the European mainland have been established. As of August 2020[update], the government\\\\s Goods Vehicle Movement Service, an IT system essential to post-Brexit goods movements, was still only in the early stages of beta testing, with four months to go before it is required to be in operation..\\\\c\\\\cConcerns have been raised that Brexit might create security problems for the UK, particularly in law enforcement and counter-terrorism where the UK could use the EU\\\\s databases on individuals crossing the British border..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit has inspired many creative works, such as murals, sculptures, novels, plays, movies and video games. The response of British artists and writers to Brexit has in general been negative, reflecting a reported overwhelming percentage of people involved in Britain\\\\s creative industries voting against leaving the European Union. Despite issues around immigration being central in the Brexit debate, British artists left the migrants\\\\ perspective largely unexplored. However, Brexit also inspired UK-based migrant artists to create new works and claim agency over their representation within public spaces and create a platform for a new social imagination that can facilitate transnational and trans-local encounters, multicultural democratic spaces, sense of commonality, and solidarity.\\\\c\\\\cAnti-Brexit protest in Manchester (2017) by sculptor Jacques Tilly.\\\\c\\\\cDuÌsseldorf carnival parade in February 2018 by German by sculptor Jacques Tilly.\\\\c\\\\cThe United Kingdom says that it has requested to respond to a European Union notification of intent to start legal proceedings over the UK\\\\s alleged breaching of the Northern Ireland Protocol by mid-May. The UK says that its unilateral delay of the introduction of new Irish Sea border checks on food, parcels and pets is lawful.\\n',\n"," 'On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Mexican American boy, was fatally shot by Chicago Police Department officer Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago.

According to the organization that runs the police database however, he had three complaints and four use of force reports on his record at the time of the shooting..\\\\c\\\\cProsecutors alleged that at around 2:30 a.m., Toledo and Roman were walking toward 24th Street when Roman fired multiple rounds as a vehicle passed. Police ShotSpotter detector technology registered shots fired and a squad car arrived at the scene. According to prosecutors\\\\ initial claims, Toledo ran away from the officers, was chased into an alleyway, turned back to the officer with a gun in his hand, and was then shot in the chest. The police claimed a handgun was recovered at the scene from behind a fence after an armed confrontation..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 15, 2021, however, the released body cam footage of Toledoâs shooting showed he was unarmed at the moment of the shooting. The video shows the officer chasing Toledo into the alleyway, where Toledo slows down and stops. In footage taken from another angle, it appears that he tosses a weapon away, over a fence. The officer points a strobe flashlight at him and yells Show me your fucking hands. Toledo then turns around with his hands up. As he does so, the officer yells drop it, and Toledo is shot by the officer. Toledo was not holding a gun when he was shot, but it is uncertain if he was armed in the moments leading up to being shot..\\\\c\\\\cAfter shooting Toledo, officer Stillman calls for medical assistance and begins to perform CPR..\\\\c\\\\cChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has called for reforms to how police pursue individuals on foot and called for a thorough, expeditious investigation. Officials have said they are in the very early stages of interviewing witnesses and officers..\\\\c\\\\cIn the lead up to the release of the body cam footage, all Chicago police officers\\\\ days off were cancelled to ensure public safety. During the press conference releasing the body cam footage, Mayor Lightfoot also stated that the city would be putting into place plans to prepare for unrest..\\\\c\\\\cToledo is believed to be the youngest person killed by the Chicago Police Department in several decades..\\\\c\\\\cProtests have occurred in Chicago in the days following Toledo\\\\s death..\\\\c\\\\cColumnist Eric Zorn wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune saying it was too early to say with confidence what happened and thus Toledo should not be portrayed as a martyr until more facts come out. His comments were received with outrage. Days later in another op-ed, Zorn wrote that the less supportive response ... took fair exception to my chilly, analytical tone ... I regret that tone. In focusing on details and marshaling evidence and arguments, I can neglect the emotional resonance in situations, as though I\\\\ve forgotten or don\\\\t care that a child who was loved has died, and that the death of someone with so much life ahead of him is always, always a tragedy. I should have done better..\\\\c\\\\cThe writer Roxanne Gay said, The Adam Toledo video was so horrifying that Chicago boarded up municipal buildings before the video was released. That tells you all you need to know..\\\\c\\\\cThe journalist Maria Hinojosa stated, Adam Toledo was a child. Not a threat..\\\\c\\\\cCongressman Joaquin Castro wrote on Twitter, Adam Toledo was 13-years-old. He complied and had his hands up. Chicago police killed him with a shot to the chest and then lied that he posed an imminent threat. The Toledo family deserves justice and accountability. His brother, former-Secretary Julian Castro, wrote, Chicago PD shot Adam Toledo with his hands in the air instantaneously after ordering him to do soâthen lied about it. They executed Adam, a boy who was not yet in high school. Indict this officer, then pass a national use of force standard immediately..\\\\c\\\\cSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote, Adam Toledo was just 13 years old. He was a child. He deserves justice. His family deserves justice..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 1, 2021, Chicago Police Department alerted its officers that Latin Kings ranked members were instructed to open fire at unmarked police cruisers to retaliate for the shooting of Adam Toledo. The warning was prioritized to officers in Little Village, between Lawndale Avenue and Whipple Street..\\\\c\\\\cSeveral protests take place around the city after the video is released, including one that briefly shut down northbound Michigan Avenue and another at Union Park.\\n',\n"," 'The GazaâIsrael conflict is a part of the localized IsraeliâPalestinian conflict, but is also a scene of power struggle between regional powers including Egypt, Iran and Turkey together with Qatar, supporting different sides of the conflict in light of the regional standoff between Iran and Saudi Arabia on one hand and between Qatar and Saudi Arabia on the other, as well as crisis in Egyptian-Turkish relations..\\\\c\\\\cThe conflict originated with the election of the Islamist political party Hamas in 2005 and 2006 in the Gaza Strip and escalated with the split of the Palestinian Authority Palestinian government into the Fatah government in the West Bank  and the Hamas government in Gaza and the following violent ousting of Fatah after Fatah lost the election to Hamas. Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, and the joint Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza have exacerbated the conflict. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets illegal under international law..\\\\c\\\\cAs part of its 2005 disengagement plan, Israel retained exclusive control over Gaza\\\\s airspace and territorial waters, continued to patrol and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of its southernmost border (where Egypt retained control of the border and border crossings were supervised by European monitors) and continued to monitor and blockade Gaza\\\\s coastline. Israel largely provides and controls Gaza\\\\s water supply, electricity and communications infrastructure.  According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Israel remains an occupying power under international law. The United Nations has stated that under resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, it regards Gaza to be part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Meanwhile, the Fatah government in the West Bank, internationally recognized as the sole representative of the State of Palestine, refers to the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian state and does not recognize the Hamas government..\\\\c\\\\cThe IsraelâGaza barrier, completed in 1996, has helped reduce infiltration from Gaza Strip into Israel.[citation needed] Since the beginning of the Second Intifada, Gazans have not been permitted to enter Israel for work purposes. Special permits to enter Israel for medical purposes were also greatly reduced,[citation needed] which has made travel for Palestinians difficult..\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Schueftan, in his 1999 book, Disengagement: Israel and the Palestinian Entity (The Need for Separation: Israel and the Palestinian Authority) reviews new and existing arguments underlying different separation stances, in order to make the case for separation from the Palestinians, beginning with those in the West Bank and Gaza. Schueftan favors the hard separation stances of politicians like Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak..\\\\c\\\\cYitzhak Rabin was the first to propose the creation of a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations in 1992, and by 1994, construction on the first barrier â the IsraelâGaza barrier â had begun; it is actually a wire fence equipped with sensors. Following an attack on Bet Lid, near the city of Netanya, Rabin specified the objectives behind the undertaking, stating that:.\\\\c\\\\cThe Second Intifada, also known as the al-Aqsa Intifada, began in September 2000. Many Palestinians consider the Intifada to be a struggle of national liberation against Israeli occupation imposed on them following the 1967 War, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cPalestinian tactics have ranged from carrying out mass protests and general strikes, as in the First Intifada, to mounting suicide bombing attacks and firing Qassam rockets into east southern Israeli residential areas. Israeli tactics range from conducting mass arrests and locking up Palestinians in administrative detention through setting up checkpoints and building the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier and West Bank barrier to carrying out assassinations targeting militants and leaders of Palestinian organizations..\\\\c\\\\cSince the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Israel has been negotiating with Mahmoud Abbas and the PLO, but has been simultaneously targeting and bombing Hamas activists and militants and arresting Hamas\\\\s elected legislative counsel politicians..\\\\c\\\\cThe death toll, both military and civilian, over the entire period in question (2000â2007) is estimated to be over 4,300 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis. To date, 64 foreign citizens have also been killed (54 by Palestinians, and 10 by Israeli security forces)..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael implemented its Disengagement Plan in AugustâSeptember 2005, withdrawing its civilian and military presence from the Gaza Strip, and retaining control over the Gaza airspace, maritime access and borders even with Egypt according to the 2005 agreement with Palestinian authority. Qassam rockets were fired regularly prior to the Israeli disengagement and the frequency of Qassam attacks increased after the Disengagement from Gaza. Palestinian militants have targeted a number of military bases and civilian towns in Southern Israel..\\\\c\\\\cSince 2001, Palestinian militants have launched thousands of rocket and mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip. Thirteen Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured as a result of Qassam rocket fire at Israeli targets. Additionally, Qassam rocket attacks have resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in both children and adults, with 33% of children living in Sderot suffering from PTSD..\\\\c\\\\cWhen the Islamic party Hamas won the January 2006 Palestinian legislative election, gaining a majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, the conflict between Israel and Gaza intensified. Israel sealed its border with the Gaza Strip, largely preventing free flow of people and many imports and exports. Palestinians have been shooting Qassam rockets at Israeli settlements located near the Gaza borders, and have staged cross-border raids aimed at killing or capturing Israeli soldiers. In one such raid, on 25 June 2006, Palestinians captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, leading to massive retaliation by the Israeli army which included air strikes against Hamas targets..\\\\c\\\\cIn June 2007, internal fighting broke out between Hamas and Fatah and Hamas fully consolidated its power by staging an armed coup d\\\\eÌtat and taking control of the Gaza Strip.  Following the internecine fighting that occurred between 7 and 15 June 2007, also known as the Battle of Gaza 2007 in which 118 Palestinians were killed and over 550 were wounded, the entire Gaza Strip came under full control of a Hamas government..\\\\c\\\\cAs a response to the Hamas takeover, Israel sharply restricted the flow of people and goods into and out of Gaza. About 70% of Gaza\\\\s workforce have become unemployed or without pay, and about 80% of its residents live in poverty..\\\\c\\\\cSince Hamas\\\\ takeover, Palestinian armed groups in Gaza and Israel continued to clash. Palestinian armed groups have fired rockets into Israel, killing Israeli civilians, including children, and wounding others, as well as causing damage to infrastructure; and Israel have launched attacks, and shelled Gaza with artillery, killing Palestinian combatants as well as civilians, including children, and causing devastating damage to infrastructure. According to Human Rights Watch, the Palestinian deliberate attacks against civilians violate international humanitarian law. Because Hamas exercises power inside Gaza, it is responsible for stopping unlawful attacks even when carried out by other groups..\\\\c\\\\cLarge-scale conventional warfare beyond the peripheries of the Gaza Strip began when Palestinian militants abducted Corporal Gilad Shalit, and Israel responded by launching Operation Summer Rains on 28 June 2006. The operation became the first major mobilization within the Gaza Strip since Israel unilaterally disengaged from the region between August and September 2005..\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza beach blast was an event on 9 June 2006 in which eight Palestinians were killed â including nearly the entire family of seven-year-old Huda Ghaliya â and at least thirty others were injured in an explosion on a beach near the municipality of Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip. The incident received considerable attention from news media worldwide, with blame for the explosion hotly disputed in the following weeks..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael maintains that it mobilized thousands of troops in order to suppress Qassam rocket fire against its civilian population and to secure the release of Gilad Shalit. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 9,000 Israeli artillery shells were fired into Gaza between September 2005 and June 2006, killing 80 Palestinians in 6 months. On the Palestinian side, over 1,300 Qassam rockets have been fired into Israel from September 2000 to 21 December 2006.[citation needed] Israeli forces also continued to search for tunnels, used by militants to smuggle weapons, as well as monitor operations at checkpoints (with some assistance from the European Union at Rafah) for security reasons, specifically possible weapons transfers and uninhibited return of exiled extremist leaders and terrorists. As of 18 October 2006, Israel has discovered 20 tunnels used for illegal arms smuggling under the border of the Gaza Strip and Egypt..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael had said it would withdraw from the Strip and end the operation as soon as Shalit was released. The Palestinians had said that they were willing to return Shalit in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The Palestinians and others have also said the assault was aimed at toppling the democratically elected Hamas-led government and at destabilizing the Palestinian National Authority, citing the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as a power station and the captures of government and parliament members. Some 300 Palestinians had been targeted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit..\\\\c\\\\cIn July 2006, first reports emerged about mystery injuries after Israeli attacks. Previously unseen injuries included severely damaged internal organs, severe internal burning and deep internal wounds often resulting in amputations or death. Bodies arrived severely fragmented, melted and disfigured. There were speculations about a new experimental weapon, particularly Dense Inert Metal Explosives (DIMEs)..\\\\c\\\\cAttempting to curb Qassam rocket attacks fired at Southern Israel by Palestinian militants from the northern Gaza Strip,.\\\\c\\\\cIsrael launched Operation Autumn Clouds on 1 November 2006..\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 November 2006, a day after Israel\\\\s withdrawal following Operation Autumn Clouds, Israel Defense Forces shells missed their targetâpossibly due to a technical malfunctionâand hit a row of houses in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, killing 19 Palestinians and wounding more than 40. Israeli Defense Forces launched an investigation into the Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident (and later apologized for the incident), and the then Israeli President Ehud Olmert offered humanitarian assistance to those affected..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2006 FrancoâItalianâSpanish Middle East Peace Plan was proposed after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in Operation Autumn Clouds by Spanish Premier JoseÌ Luis RodriÌguez Zapatero during talks with French president Jacques Chirac. Italy\\\\s prime minister Romano Prodi gave his full support to the plan..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 November, a ceasefire was signed by Palestinian organisations and Israel, and Israel withdrew its troops while the Palestinian Authority forces deployed to stop Qassam rocket launchings. Following the truce over 60 Qassam rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip at Israel, and 1 Palestinian (armed with guns and grenades) was killed by the IDF. On 19 December, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad began taking open responsibility for the Qassam rocket firing, because they said Israel killed two of their members in Jenin..\\\\c\\\\cA series of battles between Palestinian militants in Hamas-governed Gaza and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that began in mid-May 2007, with the inter-Palestinian violence flaring in the meantime. Palestinians fired more than 220 Qassam rocket attacks on Israel (Sderot and the western Negev) in more than a week. The Israeli Air Force fired missiles and bombs at the launching sites. The fighting came amid serious Palestinian factional violence and reports of growing level of humanitarian crisis in the region. Hamas said they will continue to retaliate against Israeli strikes..\\\\c\\\\cIn September 2007, citing an intensification of Qassam rocket attacks, Israel declared Gaza hostile territory. The declaration allowed Israel to prevent the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into Gaza. The stated purpose of this blockade was to pressure Hamas into ending the rocket attacks and to deprive them of the supplies necessary for the continuation of rocket attacks. Israel\\\\s decision to cut fuel supplies to Gaza were widely condemned as collective punishment..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael has also arrested Hamas officials in the West Bank, including two cabinet members. Such arrests have been strongly condemned by international organizations and politicians..\\\\c\\\\cBy January 2008, according to a United Nations study, the economic effects of Israel\\\\s blockade on Gaza reached a critical threshold. Finally, on 17 January 2008, Israel sealed the border completely following a rise in rocket attacks. The breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January 2008, after gunmen in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah Border Crossing, destroying part of the former Israeli Gaza Strip barrier. The United Nations estimates that as many as half the 1.5 million population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 February 2008, Palestinian militants fired more than 40 Qassam rockets into southern Israel and the Israeli army fired three missiles at the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza destroying the building. On 28 February 2008 Israeli aircraft bombed a police station near the Gaza City home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, killing several children. The Israeli military says its air and ground operations against militants firing rockets from northern Gaza have hit at least 23 armed Palestinians, while Palestinian sources have reported higher death tolls and say many civilians have also been killed..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael began its air and ground operations on 29 February. The IDF\\\\s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 100 Palestinians in less than a week. Palestinians fired 150 rockets at Israel which killed three Israelis. The United States called for an end to clashes between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has accused Israel of international terrorism, saying its assault on Gaza constitutes more than a holocaust. On 3 March Abbas suspended all contact with Israel over its assault on Gaza as the Israeli government sent warplanes to hit more targets early on Monday and vowed to continue its offensive. The European Union condemned what it called disproportionate use of force by the Israeli military in Gaza after 54 Palestinians were killed in the highest casualty toll for a single day since fighting erupted in 2000. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also issued a condemnation of what he termed Israel\\\\s excessive and disproportionate response, and called on Israel to cease such attacks, while denouncing the ongoing rocket attacks on Sderot and Ashkelon. In the Muslim world, demonstrators took to the streets to protest the IDF attacks. Iran\\\\s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Muslims to rise up and their leaders to hit Israel in the face with their nations\\\\ anger. In Lebanon, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters gathered at the Fatima Gate at the border between Lebanon and Israel, shouting Death to Israel and waving Lebanese and Palestinian flags. In Egypt, thousands of students held protests at universities across the country calling on Arab leaders to stop Israeli aggression and support the Palestinians. Some protesters burned Israeli and American flags. About 10,000 protesters, mainly from Jordan\\\\s mainstream Muslim Brotherhood and smaller opposition groups, took to the streets in one of the country\\\\s most vocal and largest anti-Israeli demonstrations in recent years. Saudi Arabia meanwhile compared the IDF offensive to Nazi war crimes and called on the international community to stop what it called the mass killings of Palestinians. Turkey\\\\s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the IDF attacks can have no humanitarian justification and added that Israel was rejecting a diplomatic solution to the dispute. Most Israeli tanks and troops pulled out of northern Gaza 3 March 2008, and an Israel Defense Forces spokesman confirmed that the Israeli military was ending offensive operations there after five days..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 February 2008, the Israeli military launched Operation Hot Winter (also called Operation Warm Winter) in response to Qassam rockets fired from the Strip by Hamas. The Israeli army killed 112 Palestinians, and Palestinian militants killed three Israelis. More than 150 Palestinians and seven Israelis have been injured..\\\\c\\\\cThere was widespread international alarm at the scale of the operation, with the US state department encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life, and the European Union and the United Nations criticising Israel\\\\s disproportionate use of force. The European Union also demanded an immediate end to Palestinian militant rocket attacks on Israel and urged Israel to halt activities that endanger civilians, saying they were in violation of international law..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2008 IsraelâHamas ceasefire was an Egyptian-brokered six-month Tahdia (an Arabic term for a lull) for the Gaza area, which went into effect between Hamas and Israel on 19 June 2008. Hamas\\\\ obligation was to stop the rocket attacks on Israel. During the initial 5-months of the ceasefire, and after a shaky start during the initial week, these attacks from Gaza decreased significantly for a total of 19 rocket and 18 mortar shell launchings, compared to 1199 rockets and 1072 mortar shells in 2008 up to 19 June, a reduction of 98%.  Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister acknowledged that there were no Hamas rockets during the ceasefire before November the 4th. Israel\\\\s obligation was to cease attacks on Gaza and once the ceasefire held, to gradually begin to ease its punishing blockade of Gaza. The agreement called on Israel to increase the level of goods entering Gaza by 30 percent over the pre-lull period within 72 hours and to open all border crossings and allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza within 13 days after the beginning of the ceasefire.[better source needed] The increase in supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel did improve, but the increase was only to an average of about 20 percent of normal levels, compared to the Hamas compliance in reducing rocket fire by 98%. Two months later the volume of goods arriving was too low to significantly improved living conditions, preventing UNRWA from replenishing its stores. Israel told U.S. officials in 2008 it would keep Gaza\\\\s economy on the brink of collapse..\\\\c\\\\cOn 4 November 2008 Israel broke the ceasefire with an attack on Gaza. The Israeli military claimed the target of the raid was a tunnel that they said Hamas was planning to use to capture Israeli soldiers positioned on the border fence 250m away. Hamas officials differed, however, claiming that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes, not to capture IDF personnel, according to Dr Robert Pastor (of the Carter Institute), and an IDF official confirmed that fact to him. Hamas replied to the Israeli attack with a barrage of rocket fire. With this incursion into Gaza territory and its non-compliance with the easing of the embargo, Israel had failed to comply with two aspects of the June 2008 ceasefire..\\\\c\\\\cWhen the six-month truce officially expired on 19 December, Hamas launched 50 to more than 70 rockets and mortars into Israel over the next three days, though no Israelis were injured. On 21 December, Hamas said it was ready to stop the attacks and renew the truce if Israel stopped its aggression in Gaza and opened up its border crossings. On 27 and 28 December, Israel implemented Operation Cast Lead against Hamas. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said We warned Hamas repeatedly that rejecting the truce would push Israel to aggression against Gaza..\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza War started when Israel launched a large military campaign in the Gaza Strip on 27 December 2008, codenamed Operation Cast Lead (Hebrew: ×××¦×¢ ×¢××¤×¨×ª ××¦××§×), with the stated aim of stopping Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel and arms smuggling into Gaza. The conflict has also been called the Gaza massacre in the Arab world (Arabic: ÙØ¬Ø²Ø±Ø© ØºØ²Ø©). A fragile six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired on 19 December 2008. The Israeli operation began with an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas bases, police training camps, police headquarters and offices. Civilian infrastructure, including mosques, houses, medical facilities and schools, were also attacked, as Israel stated that many of them were used by combatants, and as storage spaces for weapons and rockets. Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against targets in Israel throughout the conflict, hitting previously untargeted cities such as Beersheba and Ashdod. On 3 January 2009, the Israeli ground invasion began. Human rights groups and aid organisations have accused Hamas and Israel of war crimes. An estimated 1,166-1,417 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in the conflict. The conflict came to an end on 18 January after first Israel and then Hamas announced unilateral ceasefires. On 21 January, Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. On 2 March, it was reported that international donors had pledged $4.5 billion in aid for the Palestinians, mainly for rebuilding Gaza after Israel\\\\s offensive. This war is considered to be the largest, devastating and deadliest military operation in Gaza since the Six-day war in 1967..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 March 2010, two Israeli soldiers and two Hamas militants were killed during clashes on the Gaza Strip\\\\s southern border. Two other soldiers were wounded during the fighting which broke out east of the town of Khan Younis. They are the first Israeli soldiers to have been killed in hostile fire in or around Gaza since Israel\\\\s major offensive there in January 2009, according to the BBC..\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 August 2011, a series of cross-border attacks was carried out in southern Israel near the Egyptian border, by a squad of militants. The militants first opened fire at civilian bus. Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel\\\\s border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the second week of March 2012, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation Returning Echo. It was the worst outbreak of violence covered by the media in the region since the 2008â09 Operation Cast Lead (the Gaza War)..\\\\c\\\\cAttacks by Israel and Gazans grew intense late in October 2012. An Israeli air strike killed Ahmed Jabari, chief of the Hamas military wing in Gaza. During the operation, four Israeli civilians and one soldier were killed by Palestinian rocket fire, according to Palestinian Centre for Human Rights 158 Palestinians had been killed, of which: 102 were civilians, 55 militants and one was policeman. 30 children and 13 women were among the killed, while the Israel Defense Forces presented statistics showing that out of 177 Palestinians killed, 120 were militants.  Most of the fighting was by bombs, aerial attacks, artillery, and rockets; the rockets being primarily used by the Palestinians and air strikes primarily by the Israelis. Attacked locations include Beersheva, Tel Aviv, Ashdod, Ofakim, Gaza, the rest of the Gaza Strip, the Shaar Hanegev, and Eshkol Regional Council. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and other Western countries expressed support for Israel\\\\s right to defend itself, and/or[clarification needed] condemned the Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. Iran, Egypt, Turkey, North Korea and several other Arab and Muslim countries condemned the Israeli operation..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2014, fighting intensified between Israel and Hamas, leading to another full-scale Gaza War, this one far deadlier than the previous in 2008â2009. The IDF launched Operation Protective Edge on 8 July 2014, in response to Hamas rocket attacks, which were launched following an earlier Israeli air strike against Gaza and on 17 July 2014, Israel troops entered the Gaza Strip. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the conflict. The war came to an end after 50 days of conflict when a ceasefire was agreed upon on 26 August 2014..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 2018 Land Day protests, 168 Palestinians have been killed and thousands were injured during clashes with Israeli troops at the Gaza-Israel border..\\\\c\\\\cViolence flared up again on 11 November 2018 when seven Palestinian militants were killed during a botched raid by the Israel Defense Forces in the southeastern Gaza Strip. One IDF officer was killed and another was injured. Over a dozen rockets were subsequently fired from Gaza, three of which were shot down. After a series of intense fire exchanges, ceasefire was agreed upon on 13 November 2018..\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 March, seven people were injured in Israel after a rocket attack destroyed a home in Mishmeret. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that Hamas was responsible for the attack..\\\\c\\\\cThe Israeli Air Force sent jets to strike multiple targets in the Gaza Strip, including the office of senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh, and Hamas\\\\ military intelligence headquarters in Gaza City..\\\\c\\\\cOn 3 May, two Israeli soldiers were injured by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper from in the Gaza Strip during the weekly protests at the GazaâIsrael border. In response, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike, killing four Palestinians. In addition, two other Palestinians were killed and 60 wounded, 36 of them by Israeli gunfire..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing this, Gazan militants launched hundreds of rockets at Israel. In response, the Israeli Air Force struck numerous targets within the Gaza Strip. In addition, Israel increased its troop presence near the GazaâIsrael border..\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 July 2014 on the 23rd day of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict, Ireland\\\\s Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said he shared the horror and revulsion of senators and very many of our citizens at the horrendous scenes we have witnessed since the start of the Israeli military operation. The Irish government, he said, condemned both the unacceptably high civilian casualty rate resulting from disproportionate military action on Israel\\\\s part as well as the firing of rockets by Hamas and other militants into Israel. On 5 August 2014 a member of the British cabinet resigned over the UK government\\\\s approach to the 2014 conflict..\\\\c\\\\cPresidential campaigns of 2016, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Israel for its treatment of Gaza, and in particular criticized Netanyahu for overreacting and causing unnecessary civilian deaths. In April 2016 the Anti-Defamation League called on Sanders to withdraw remarks he made to the New York Daily News, which the ADL said exaggerated the death toll of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict. Sanders said over 10,000 innocent people were killed, a number far in excess of Palestinian or Israel sources\\\\ estimates. In response, Sanders said that he accepted a corrected number of the death toll as 2,300 in the course of the interview and that he would make every effort to set the record straight. The transcript of the interview failed to note that Sanders said Okay to the corrected number presented by the interviewer during the course of the interview..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to NGOs and the UN, the recent wars and the blockade have led to worsting living conditions in Gaza and could be become unlivable by 2020..\\\\c\\\\cDue to the conflict, Israel has stepped up its defense measures in the southern communities and cities of Israel. This includes building fortifications on existing structures and bomb shelters, developing an alarm system (Red Color) and building an air-defense system (Iron Dome) .\\\\c\\\\cIsraeli Air Force jets and helicopters strike Hamas-linked targets in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for earlier rocket fire targeting southern Israel. The IDF says that an armaments production facility and a tunnel used to smuggle weapons were hit.\\n',\n"," 'On April 15, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Nine people were killed, including the gunman, 19-year-old former employee Brandon Scott Hole, who committed suicide. Four others were injured. Hole\\\\s motive remains unknown..\\\\c\\\\cThe FedEx facility where the shooting occurred is located in the southwestern part of the city, near Indianapolis International Airport. It is the company\\\\s second-busiest hub, with nearly 4,000 employees in total. The building is equipped with metal detectors and security turnstiles at its entrance requiring the employees to scan their FedEx badges. There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the shooting, and many of them were changing shifts or on dinner breaks..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt, the gunman entered the facility in a vehicle and, after exiting unprovoked, immediately began firing. Afterwards, the gunman entered the facility and began shooting again. The shooting lasted several minutes. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene shortly after 11:00 p.m. However, the shooter took his own life by that point..\\\\c\\\\cThe shooting resulted in a brief closure of Interstate 70 at Ameriplex Parkway, which reopened shortly afterwards..\\\\c\\\\cThere were nine fatalities in the shooting, including the gunman. Excluding the gunman, four victims were found dead outside of the facility, with the other four being found dead inside. Five people were taken to the hospital, including one in critical condition; four of them suffered gunshot wounds..\\\\c\\\\cPolice identified the gunman as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old resident of Indiana who had been employed at the Indianapolis facility until 2020. After the shooting, authorities conducted a search of his home and seized evidence, including electronics..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2020, Hole\\\\s mother contacted the FBI and local authorities and warned them about her son\\\\s intent to commit suicide by cop, prompting a preliminary investigation to be opened. Hole was placed in a temporary mental health hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. They seized a shotgun from him, and the FBI questioned Hole about unspecified items found in his bedroom in April 2020. Eventually, the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence of any criminal violation, and the shotgun was not returned to Hole.

The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court..\\\\c\\\\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, flew under the radar, adding, This is simply not a big group that we\\\\d ever heard of..\\\\c\\\\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group\\\\s ideology adhered to..\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she also became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May, including one in which armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. President Donald Trump had offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer that woman from Michigan and tweeting on April 17: LIBERATE MICHIGAN!.\\\\c\\\\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4â3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services â and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration â to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public..\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group\\\\s commander. An NBC News investigation into the suspects\\\\ social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material..\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators..\\\\c\\\\cMorrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words Liberty or Death. Morrison\\\\s neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home\\\\s residents were disrespectful and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was Boogaloo Bunyan. Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges..\\\\c\\\\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother\\\\s maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop\\\\s owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group\\\\s meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer\\\\s handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to rage issues and threatening other members on social media..\\\\c\\\\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor\\\\s vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for night fishing as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record..\\\\c\\\\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country\\\\s current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an uprising. However, he also included Trump\\\\s name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder..\\\\c\\\\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts..\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence. The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot..\\\\c\\\\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer\\\\s implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began liking posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers..\\\\c\\\\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled Gretchen Whitmer Interview, depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico\\\\s attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too soft and wouldn\\\\t commit to violence..\\\\c\\\\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house\\\\s yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013..\\\\c\\\\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month..\\\\c\\\\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer\\\\s COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump\\\\s Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook..\\\\c\\\\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar\\\\s former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a very angry person and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar\\\\s father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder..\\\\c\\\\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s home..\\\\c\\\\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. In March 2020, local officers from an unidentified police department in Michigan reported to the FBI that the militia was seeking addresses of officers. The FBI then interviewed a militia member, who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill police officers. On May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft\\\\s Facebook account. Agents found messages plotting potential acts of violence, including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who may be first and was wanted in custody; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster..\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages, was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen\\\\s arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated a violent intent..\\\\c\\\\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer\\\\s address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. The plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how tyrants should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia â already being investigated by the FBI â seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested 200 men to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a trial for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises..\\\\c\\\\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state\\\\s order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a tyrant bitch and stating to viewers, I don\\\\t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do..\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member\\\\s property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico\\\\s defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan\\\\s tactical viability, saying, It\\\\s a fishbowl. Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Musico\\\\s attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico\\\\s eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI\\\\s confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time..\\\\c\\\\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer\\\\s family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor\\\\s office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\\\\m not even fuckin\\\\ kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\\\\t fuckin\\\\ care anymore, I\\\\m just so sick of it. That\\\\s what it\\\\s gonna take for us to take it back, we\\\\re just gonna have to everything\\\\s gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\\\\re gonna topple it all, dude. It\\\\s what great frickin\\\\ conquerors, man, we\\\\re just gonna conquer every fuckin\\\\ thing man. In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out, with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a widespread bombing campaign, according to the FBI..\\\\c\\\\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor\\\\s Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\\\\ Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it\\\\s over. Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer\\\\s exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions..\\\\c\\\\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor\\\\s residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer\\\\s boat. Harris said in a chat, Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself. During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat..\\\\c\\\\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\\\\ home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, We ain\\\\t gonna let \\\\em burn our fuckin\\\\ state down. I don\\\\t give a fuck if there\\\\s only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\\\\ll go out there and use deadly force. The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge near the vacation home to slow and distract police..\\\\c\\\\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor\\\\s Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying perimeter security and other safety upgrades were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer..\\\\c\\\\cWhile driving in three vehiclesâwith an undercover FBI agent and confidential source presentâfrom a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin\\\\s property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely..\\\\c\\\\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin\\\\s property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping. An undercover agent told Fox that explosives for destroying the bridge leading to the lake would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting..\\\\c\\\\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment..\\\\c\\\\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry an automatic sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam\\\\s security staff about the potential threat..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found explosive device components and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and all anti-Americans..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 30, Franks\\\\s attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a violent extremist and saying such a decision would be unreasonable..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors..\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico\\\\s bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial..\\\\c\\\\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13..\\\\c\\\\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client\\\\s plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond..\\\\c\\\\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge..\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters sick and depraved men, and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House. Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump\\\\s rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country..\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot one of the largest cases in recent history and labeled the case as rather unprecedented in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\\\\ original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges disturbing and said, This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police..\\\\c\\\\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of extreme violence and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan\\\\s schools and churches were closed under Whitmer\\\\s orders. In response to Trump\\\\s remarks, Whitmer said it tells you everything you need to know about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump\\\\s remarks on October 16, saying the failure to condemn these folks is stunning..\\\\c\\\\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of Lock her up!, to which he replied, Lock \\\\em all up. Trump\\\\s daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely having fun at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC\\\\s Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump\\\\s rhetoric incredibly disturbing and said it is inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism. She also countered Trump\\\\s claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\\\\t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of Lock her up!..\\\\c\\\\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response..\\\\c\\\\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it\\\\s a felony, make a felony arrest. Citing the state\\\\s citizen\\\\s arrest statute, he continued, It doesn\\\\t say if you are an elected office that you\\\\re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\\\\m hoping that\\\\s more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\\\\m not even sure if they had any part of it..\\\\c\\\\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as dangerous, while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen\\\\s arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called horrible. His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign..\\\\c\\\\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April..\\\\c\\\\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan\\\\s electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\\\\ offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following credible threats of violence. The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a Hail Mary effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, No. I don\\\\t know. Because what we\\\\re doing today is uncharted. Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17..\\\\c\\\\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer\\\\s kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI\\\\s investigation..\\\\c\\\\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired..\\\\c\\\\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\\\\ actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen\\\\s actions..\\\\c\\\\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as Mostly False..\\\\c\\\\cA judge lifts the curfew and house arrest restrictions of two brothers who are suspected of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer last year. However, they are still required to wear GPS tethers.\\n',\n"," 'Brexit (/ËbrÉksÉªt, ËbrÉÉ¡zÉªt/; a portmanteau of British exit) was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) at the end of 31 January 2020 CET. The UK is the first and only country formally to leave the EU, after 47 years of having been a member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Communities (EC), since 1 January 1973. It continued to participate in the European Union Customs Union and European Single Market during a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET)..\\\\c\\\\cThe European Union and its institutions have developed gradually since their establishment, including 47 years of British membership, and grew to be of significant importance to the UK. Throughout that time Eurosceptic groups had existed, opposing aspects of the Union and its predecessors. Prime Minister Harold Wilsonâs pro-Europe government held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975 in which voters chose to stay within the bloc with 67.2% of the vote share, but no further referendums were held as the project grew and became ever-closer in the subsequent Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. Facing pressure from Eurosceptic groups, Prime Minister David Cameron\\\\s pro-Europe government held a second referendum on continued EU membership in 2016 in which voters chose to leave the EU with 51.9% of the vote share. This led to his resignation, replacement by Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and future relations. This process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, with one deal rejected by the British parliament, general elections held in 2017 and 2019, and two new Prime Ministers in that time, both Conservative. Under Boris Johnson\\\\s government, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 CET; trade deal negotiations continued to within days of the scheduled end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 CET..\\\\c\\\\cThe effects of Brexit will in part be determined by the EUâUK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was agreed on 24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK Parliament on 30 December 2020 and was provisionally applied by the EU from 31 December 2020. The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK\\\\s economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for British higher education, academic research and security; the Turing scheme was announced as a new global student exchange programme in early 2021 to combat this. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over British laws or its Supreme Court. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, in which 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48.11% voted to remain a member, Prime Minister David Cameron resigned. On 29 March 2017, the new British Government led by Theresa May formally notified the EU of the country\\\\s intention to withdraw, beginning the Brexit process. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for 29 March 2019. It was delayed by deadlock in the British Parliament after the June 2017 general election, which resulted in a hung parliament in which the Conservatives lost their majority but remained the largest party. This deadlock led to three extensions of the Article 50 process..\\\\c\\\\cThe deadlock was resolved after a subsequent general election was held in December 2019. In that election, Conservatives who campaigned in support of a revised withdrawal agreement led by Boris Johnson won an overall majority of 80 seats. After the December 2019 election, the British Parliament finally ratified the withdrawal agreement. The UK left the EU at the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11 p.m. This began a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 CET (11 p.m. GMT), during which the UK and EU negotiated their future relationship. During the transition, the UK remained subject to EU law and remained part of the EU customs union and single market. However, it was no longer part of the EU\\\\s political bodies or institutions..\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal was advocated by hard Eurosceptics and opposed by pro-Europeanists and soft Eurosceptics, with both sides of the argument spanning the political spectrum. The UK joined the European Communities (EC) â principally the European Economic Community (EEC) â in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in the 1975 referendum. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the Labour Party\\\\s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty founded the EU, was ratified by the British Parliament in 1993 but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party led a rebellion over ratification of the treaty and, with the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the cross-party People\\\\s Pledge campaign then led a collective campaign particularly after the Treaty of Lisbon was also ratified by the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 without being put to a referendum following a previous promise to hold a referendum on ratifying the abandoned European Constitution was never held eventually pressured the Conservative prime minister David Cameron to hold the June 2016 membership referendum. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by Theresa May..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 March 2017, the British government formally began the withdrawal process by invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union with permission from Parliament. May called a snap general election in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government supported by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). UKâEU withdrawal negotiations began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 withdrawal agreement, but the British parliament voted against ratifying it three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement\\\\s financial settlement, as well as the Irish backstop designed to prevent border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a proposed second referendum..\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 March 2019, the British Parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until June, and then later October. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by Boris Johnson. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. On 17 October 2019, the British Government and the EU agreed on a revised withdrawal agreement, with new arrangements for Northern Ireland. Parliament approved the agreement for further scrutiny, but rejected passing it into law before the 31 October deadline, and forced the government (through the Benn Act) to ask for a third Brexit delay. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020. The withdrawal agreement was ratified by the UK on 23 January and by the EU on 30 January; it came into force on 31 January 2020..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the referendum of 23 June 2016, many new pieces of Brexit-related jargon entered popular use..\\\\c\\\\cThe Inner Six European countries signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951, establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The 1955 Messina Conference deemed that the ECSC was a success, and resolved to extend the concept further, thereby leading to the 1957 Treaties of Rome establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). In 1967, these became known as the European Communities (EC). The UK attempted to join in 1963 and 1967, but these applications were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle..\\\\c\\\\cSome time after de Gaulle resigned in 1969, the UK successfully applied for EC membership, and the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972. Parliament passed the European Communities Act later that year and the UK joined Denmark and Ireland in becoming a member on 1 January 1973..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party was the more Eurosceptic of the two major parties, and the Conservatives the more Europhile. The 1983 Labour Party manifesto would even pledge to leave the then European Economic Community. Earlier on, Labour had won the February 1974 general election without a majority and then contested the subsequent October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain\\\\s terms of membership of the EC, believing them to be unfavourable, and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EC on the new terms. Labour again won the election (this time with a small majority), and in 1975 the UK held its first ever national referendum, asking whether the UK should remain in the EC. Despite significant division within the ruling Labour Party, all major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. On 5 June 1975, 67.2% of the electorate and all but two British counties and regions voted to stay in; support for the UK to leave the EC in 1975 appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum..\\\\c\\\\cThe Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EC without a referendum. After their heavy defeat in that election, Labour changed its policy. In 1985, the second Margaret Thatcher government ratified the Single European Actâthe first major revision to the Treaty of Romeâwithout a referendum.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cIn October 1990, under pressure from senior ministers and despite Thatcher\\\\s deep reservations, the UK joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the pound sterling pegged to the deutschmark. Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister the following month, amid Conservative Party divisions arising partly from her increasingly Eurosceptic views. The UK and Italy were forced to withdraw from the ERM in September 1992, after the pound sterling and the lira came under pressure from currency speculation (Black Wednesday)..\\\\c\\\\cUnder the Maastricht Treaty, the EC became the EU on 1 November 1993, reflecting the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political one. Denmark, France, and Ireland held referendums to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. In accordance with Constitution of the United Kingdom, specifically that of parliamentary sovereignty, ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian Vernon Bogdanor wrote that there was a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK\\\\s previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had no way to express it. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimateâwhich requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain\\\\s relationship with the [EC]. This perceived democratic deficit directly led to the formation of the Referendum Party and the UK Independence Party.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cThatcher, who had previously supported the common market and the Single European Act, in the Bruges speech of 1988 warned against a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. She influenced Daniel Hannan, who in 1990 founded the Oxford Campaign for Independent Britain; With hindsight, some see this as the start of the campaign for Brexit, the Financial Times later wrote. In 1994, Sir James Goldsmith formed the Referendum Party to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the nature of the UK\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. The party fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election, and won 810,860 votesâ2.6% of the total votes castâbut failed to win a parliamentary seat because the vote was spread across the country. The Referendum Party disbanded after Goldsmith\\\\s death in 1997.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cThe UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was formed in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than Labour or the Conservatives had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election. UKIP\\\\s electoral success in the 2014 European election is documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum..\\\\c\\\\cUKIP won two by-elections (triggered by defecting Conservative MPs) in 2014; in the 2015 general election, the party took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014..\\\\c\\\\cBoth pro- and anti-EU views had majority support at different times from 1977 to 2015. In the EC membership referendum of 1975, two-thirds of British voters favoured continued EC membership. Over the decades of UK-EU membership, Euroscepticism existed on both the left and right of British politics..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to a statistical analysis published in April 2016 by Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, surveys showed an increase in Euroscepticism (defined as a wish to sever or reduce the powers of the EU) from 38% in 1993 to 65% in 2015. The BSA survey for the period of JulyâNovember 2015 showed that 60% backed the option to continue as a member and 30% backed withdrawal..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron initially rejected calls for a referendum on the UK\\\\s EU membership, but then suggested the possibility of a future referendum to endorse his proposed renegotiation of Britain\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. According to the BBC, The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK\\\\s [renegotiated] position within the [EU] had \\\\the full-hearted support of the British people\\\\ but they needed to show \\\\tactical and strategic patience\\\\. On 23 January 2013, under pressure from many of his MPs and from the rise of UKIP, Cameron promised in his Bloomberg speech that a Conservative government would hold an in-or-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in the 7 May 2015 general election. This was included in the Conservative Party manifesto for the election..\\\\c\\\\cThe Conservative Party won the election with a majority. Soon afterwards, the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Cameron favoured remaining in a reformed EU, and sought to renegotiate on four key points: protection of the single market for non-eurozone countries, reduction of red tape, exempting Britain from ever-closer union, and restricting immigration from the rest of the EU..\\\\c\\\\cIn December 2015, opinion polls showed a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU; they also showed support would drop if Cameron did not negotiate adequate safeguards[definition needed] for non-eurozone member states, and restrictions on benefits for non-UK EU citizens..\\\\c\\\\cThe outcome of the renegotiations was revealed in February 2016. Some limits to in-work benefits for new EU immigrants were agreed, but before they could be applied, a member state such as the UK would have to get permission from the European Commission and then from the European Council, which is composed of the heads of government of every member state..\\\\c\\\\cIn a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016, and commented on the renegotiation settlement. He spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a Leave vote and of the two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the original wording for the referendum question was challenged, the government agreed to change the official referendum question to Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?.\\\\c\\\\cIn the referendum 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU (Leave), and 48.11% voted in favour of remaining a member of the EU (Remain). After this result, Cameron resigned on 13 July 2016, with Theresa May becoming Prime Minister after a leadership contest. A petition calling for a second referendum attracted more than four million signatures, but was rejected by the government on 9 July..\\\\c\\\\cA 2017 study published in Economic Policy showed that the Leave vote tended to be greater in areas which had lower incomes and high unemployment, a strong tradition of manufacturing employment, and in which the population had fewer qualifications. It also tended to be greater where there was a large flow of Eastern European migrants (mainly low-skilled workers) into areas with a large share of native low-skilled workers. Those in lower social grades (especially the working class) were more likely to vote Leave, while those in higher social grades (especially the upper middle class) more likely to vote Remain. Studies found that the Leave vote tended to be higher in areas affected by economic decline, high rates of suicides and drug-related deaths, and austerity reforms introduced in 2010..\\\\c\\\\cStudies suggest that older people were more likely to vote Leave, and younger people more likely to vote Remain. According to Thomas Sampson, an economist at the London School of Economics, Older and less-educated voters were more likely to vote \\\\leave\\\\ [...] A majority of white voters wanted to leave, but only 33% of Asian voters and 27% of black voters chose leave. There was no gender split in the vote [...] Leaving the European Union received support from across the political spectrum [...] Voting to leave the European Union was strongly associated with holding socially conservative political beliefs, opposing cosmopolitanism, and thinking life in Britain is getting worse..\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polls found that Leave voters believed leaving the EU was more likely to bring about a better immigration system, improved border controls, a fairer welfare system, better quality of life, and the ability to control our own laws, while Remain voters believed EU membership would be better for the economy, international investment, and the UK\\\\s influence in the world. Polls found that the main reasons people voted Leave were the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK, and that leaving offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders. The main reason people voted Remain was that the risks of voting to leave the EU looked too great when it came to things like the economy, jobs and prices..\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal from the European Union is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. It was originally drafted by Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, and introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon at the insistence of the United Kingdom.[citation needed] The article states that any member state can withdraw in accordance with its own constitutional requirements by notifying the European Council of its intention to do so. The notification triggers a two-year negotiation period, in which the EU must negotiate and conclude an agreement with [the leaving] State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the [European] Union. If no agreement is reached within the two years, the membership ends without an agreement, unless an extension is unanimously agreed among all EU states, including the withdrawing state. On the EU side, the agreement needs to be ratified by qualified majority in the European Council, and by the European Parliament..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2015 Referendum Act did not expressly require Article 50 to be invoked, but prior to the referendum, the British government said it would respect the result. When Cameron resigned following the referendum, he said that it would be for the incoming prime minister to invoke Article 50. The new prime minister, Theresa May, said she would wait until 2017 to invoke the article, in order to prepare for the negotiations. In October 2016, she said Britain would trigger Article 50 in March 2017, and in December she gained the support of MP\\\\s for her timetable..\\\\c\\\\cIn January 2017, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled in the Miller case that government could only invoke Article 50 if authorised by an act of parliament to do so. The government subsequently introduced a bill for that purpose, and it was passed into law on 16 March as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. On 29 March, Theresa May triggered Article 50 when Tim Barrow, the British ambassador to the EU, delivered the invocation letter to European Council President Donald Tusk. This made 29 March 2019 the expected date that UK would leave EU..\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2017, Theresa May called a snap general election, held on 8 June, in an attempt to strengthen [her] hand in the negotiations; The Conservative Party, Labour and UKIP made manifesto pledges to implement the referendum, the Labour manifesto differing in its approach to Brexit negotiations, such as unilaterally offering permanent residence to EU immigrants. The Liberal Democrat Party and the Green Party manifestos proposed a policy of remaining in the EU via a second referendum. The Scottish National Party (SNP) manifesto proposed a policy of waiting for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and then holding a referendum on Scottish independence..\\\\c\\\\cThe result produced an unexpected hung parliament, the governing Conservatives gained votes (but nevertheless lost seats and their majority in the House of Commons) but remained the largest party. Labour gained significantly on votes and seats, retaining its position as the second-largest party. The Liberal Democrats gained six seats despite a slight decrease in vote share compared with 2015. The Green Party kept its single MP while also losing national vote share. Losing votes and seats were the SNP, which lost 21 MPs, and UKIP, which suffered a -10.8% swing and lost its only MP. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FeÌin also made gains in votes and seats..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 June 2017, Conservatives and the DUP reached a confidence and supply agreement whereby the DUP would back the Conservatives in key votes in the House of Commons over the course of the parliament. The agreement included additional funding of Â£1 billion for Northern Ireland, highlighted mutual support for Brexit and national security, expressed commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and indicated that policies such as the state pension triple lock and Winter Fuel Payments would be maintained..\\\\c\\\\cPrior to the negotiations, May said that the British government would not seek permanent single market membership, would end ECJ jurisdiction, seek a new trade agreement, end free movement of people and maintain the Common Travel Area with Ireland. The EU had adopted its negotiating directives in May, and appointed Michel Barnier as Chief Negotiator. The EU wished to perform the negotiations in two phases:  first the UK would agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, and then negotiations on a future relationship could begin. In the first phase, the member states would demand that the UK pay a divorce bill, initially estimated as amounting to Â£52 billion. EU negotiators said that an agreement must be reached between UK and the EU by October 2018..\\\\c\\\\cNegotiations commenced on 19 June 2017. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa; Britain\\\\s outstanding financial obligations to the EU; and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In December 2017, a partial agreement was reached. It ensured that there would be no hard border in Ireland, protected the rights of UK citizens in EU and EU citizens in Britain, and estimated the financial settlement to be Â£35â39 billion. May stressed that Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Following this partial agreement, EU leaders agreed to move on to the second phase in the negotiations:  discussion of the future relationship, a transition period and a possible trade deal..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2018, a 21-month transition period and the terms for it were provisionally agreed. In June 2018, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that there had been little progress on the Irish border questionâon which the EU proposed a backstop, to come into effect if no overall trade deal had been reached by the end of the transition periodâand that it was unlikely that there would be a solution before October, when the whole deal was to be agreed. In July 2018, the British government published the Chequers plan, its aims for the future relationship to be determined in the negotiations. The plan sought to keep British access to the single market for goods, but not necessarily for services, while allowing for an independent trade policy. The plan caused cabinet resignations, including Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson..\\\\c\\\\cOn 13 November 2018, UK and EU negotiators agreed the text of a draft withdrawal agreement, and May secured her cabinet\\\\s backing of the deal the following day, though Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned over fatal flaws in the agreement. It was expected that ratification in the British parliament would be difficult. On 25 November, all 27 leaders of the remaining EU countries endorsed the agreement..\\\\c\\\\cOn 10 December 2018, the Prime Minister postponed the vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal. This came minutes after the Prime Minister\\\\s Office confirmed the vote would be going ahead. Faced with the prospect of a defeat in the House of Commons, this option gave May more time to negotiate with Conservative backbenchers and the EU, even though they had ruled out further discussions. The decision was met with calls from many Welsh Labour MPs for a motion of no confidence in the Government..\\\\c\\\\cAlso on 10 December 2018, the European Court of Justice(ECJ) ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its notification of withdrawal, as long as it was still a member and had not agreed a withdrawal agreement. The decision to do so should be unequivocal and unconditional and follow a democratic process.If the British revoked their notification, they would remain a member of the EU under their current membership terms. The case was launched by Scottish politicians, and referred to the ECJ by the Scottish Court of Session..\\\\c\\\\cThe European Research Group (ERG), a staunchly anti-EU grouping in Conservative Party, opposed the Prime Minister\\\\s proposed Withdrawal Agreement treaty. Its members objected strongly to the Withdrawal Agreement\\\\s inclusion of the Irish backstop. ERG members also objected to the proposed Â£39 billion financial settlement with the EU and stated that the agreement would result in the UK\\\\s agreement to continuing to follow EU regulations in major policy areas; and to the continuing jurisdiction of the ECJ over interpretation of the agreement and of European law still applicable to the UK..\\\\c\\\\cOn 15 January 2019, the House of Commons voted 432 to 202 against the deal, which was the largest majority ever against a United Kingdom government. Soon after, a motion of no confidence in Her Majesty\\\\s Government was tabled by the opposition, which was rejected by 325 votes to 306..\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 February, Prime Minister May proposed that the next vote on the withdrawal agreement would be on 12 March 2019, 17 days away from the Brexit date. On 12 March, the proposal was defeated by 391 votes to 242âa loss by 149 votes, down from 230 from when the deal had been proposed in January..\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 March 2019, the Speaker informed the House of Commons that a third meaningful vote could be held only on a motion that was significantly different from the previous one, citing parliamentary precedents going back to 1604..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement was brought back to the House without the attached understandings on 29 March. The Government\\\\s motion of support for the Withdrawal Agreement was defeated by 344 votes to 286âa loss by 58 votes, down from 149 when the deal had been proposed on 12 March..\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 March 2019, the Prime Minister wrote to European Council President Tusk requesting that Brexit be postponed until 30 June 2019. On 21 March 2019, May presented her case to a European Council summit meeting in Brussels. After May left the meeting, a discussion amongst the remaining EU leaders resulted in the rejection of 30 June date and offered instead a choice of two new alternative Brexit dates. On 22 March 2019, the extension options were agreed between the British government and the European Council. The first alternative offered was that if MPs rejected May\\\\s deal in the next week, Brexit would be due to occur by 12 April 2019, with, or without, a dealâor alternatively another extension be asked for and a commitment to participate in the 2019 European Parliament elections given. The second alternative offered was that if MPs approved May\\\\s deal, Brexit would be due to occur on 22 May 2019. The later date was the day before the start of European Parliament elections. After the government deemed unwarranted the concerns over the legality of the proposed change (because it contained two possible exit dates) the previous day, on 27 March 2019 both the Lords (without a vote) and the Commons (by 441 to 105) approved the statutory instrument changing the exit date to 22 May 2019 if a withdrawal deal is approved, or 12 April 2019 if it is not. The amendment was then signed into law at 12:40 p.m. the next day..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the failure of the British Parliament to approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March, the UK was required to leave the EU on 12 April 2019. On 10 April 2019, late-night talks in Brussels resulted in a further extension, to 31 October 2019; Theresa May had again requested an extension only until 30 June. Under the terms of this new extension, if the Withdrawal Agreement were to be passed before October, Brexit would occur on the first day of the subsequent month. The UK would then be obligated to hold European Parliament elections in May, or leave the EU on 1 June without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cIn granting the Article 50 extensions, the EU adopted a stance of refusing to reopen (that is, renegotiate) the Withdrawal Agreement..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Boris Johnson became prime minister on 24 July 2019 and met with EU leaders, the EU changed its stance. On 17 October 2019, following tunnel talks between UK and EU, a revised withdrawal agreement was agreed on negotiators level, and endorsed by the British government and the EU Commission. The revised deal contained a new Northern Ireland Protocol, as well as technical modifications to related articles. In addition, the Political Declaration was also revised. The revised deal and the political declaration was endorsed by the European Council later that day. To come into effect, it needed to be ratified by the European Parliament and the Parliament of the United Kingdom..\\\\c\\\\cThe British Parliament passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, which received Royal Assent on 9 September 2019, obliging the Prime Minister to seek a third extension if no agreement has been reached at the next European Council meeting in October 2019. In order for such an extension to be granted if it is requested by the Prime Minister, it would be necessary for there to be unanimous agreement by all other heads of EU governments. On 28 October 2019, the third extension was agreed to by the EU, with a new withdrawal deadline of 31 January 2020. \\\\Exit day\\\\ in British law was then amended to this new date by statutory instrument on 30 October 2019..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Johnson was unable to induce Parliament to approve a revised version of the withdrawal agreement by the end of October, he chose to call for a snap election. The House of Commons supported the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 by 438â20, setting the election date for Thursday 12 December. Opinion polls up to polling day showed a firm lead for the Conservatives against Labour throughout the campaign..\\\\c\\\\cIn the run-up to the general election on 12 December 2019 the Conservative Party pledged to leave the EU with the withdrawal agreement negotiated in October 2019. Labour promised to renegotiate aforementioned deal and hold a referendum, letting voters choose between the renegotiated deal and remain. The Liberal Democrats vowed to revoke Article 50, while the SNP intended to hold a second referendum, however, revoking Article 50 if the alternative was a no-deal exit. The DUP supported Brexit, but would seek to change parts related to Northern Ireland it was dissatisfied with. Plaid Cymru and the Green Party backed a second referendum, believing the UK should stay in the EU. The Brexit Party was the only major party running for election which wanted the UK to leave the EU without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cThe election produced a decisive result for Boris Johnson with the Conservatives winning 365 seats (gaining 47 seats) and a overall majority of 80 seats with Labour suffering their worst election defeat since 1935 after losing 60 seats to leave them with 202 seats and only a single seat in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats won just 11 seats with their leader Jo Swinson losing her own seat. The Scottish National Party won 48 seats after gaining 14 seats in Scotland..\\\\c\\\\cThe result broke the deadlock in the British Parliament and ended the possibility of a referendum being held on the withdrawal agreement and ensured that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on 31 January 2020..\\\\c\\\\cSubsequently, the government introduced a bill to ratify the withdrawal agreement. It passed its second reading in the House of Commons in a 358â234 vote on 20 December 2019, and became law on 23 January 2020.\\\\c\\\\cas the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020..\\\\c\\\\cThe withdrawal agreement received the backing of the constitutional committee in the European Parliament on 23 January 2020, setting expectation that the entire parliament would approve it in a later vote. On the following day, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel signed the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, and it was sent to London where Boris Johnson signed it. The European Parliament gave its consent to ratification on 29 January by 621 votes to 49. Immediately after voting approval, members of the European Parliament joined hands and sang Auld Lang Syne. The Council of the European Union concluded EU ratification the following day..\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 January 2020 at 11 p.m. GMT, the United Kingdom\\\\s membership of the European Union ended 47 years after it joined..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the British exit on 31 January 2020 the UK entered a Transition Period. Trade, travel and freedom of movement remain largely unchanged during this period. The transition period ended at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET) on 31 December 2020..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement still applies after this date. This agreement provides free access of goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, provided checks are made to goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The British Government attempted to back out of this commitment by passing the Internal Market Bill: domestic legislation in the British Parliament. In September, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said:.\\\\c\\\\cleading to the resignation of Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department and Lord Keen, the law officer for Scotland. The EU started legal action..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the transition period, David Frost and Michel Barnier continued to negotiate a permanent trade agreement. On 24 December 2020 both parties announced that a deal had been reached. The deal was passed by both houses of the British parliament on 30 December and given Royal Assent in the early hours of the next day. The transition period concluded under its terms the following evening. After the UK said it would unilaterally extend a grace period limiting checks on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the European Parliament postponed setting a date to ratify the agreement..\\\\c\\\\cIn October 2016, Theresa May promised a Great Repeal Bill, which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in British law all enactments previously in force under EU law. Subsequently renamed the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, it was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017..\\\\c\\\\cOn 12 September 2017, the bill passed its first vote and second reading by a margin of 326 votes to 290 votes in the House of Commons. The bill was further amended on a series of votes in both Houses. After the Act became law on 26 June 2018, the European Council decided on 29 June to renew its call on Member States and European Union institutions to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act fixed the period ending 21 January 2019 for the government to decide on how to proceed if the negotiations had not reached agreement in principle on both the withdrawal arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and EU; while, alternatively, making future ratification of the withdrawal agreement as a treaty between the UK and EU depend upon the prior enactment of another act of Parliament for approving the final terms of withdrawal when the Brexit negotiations were completed. In any event, the act did not alter the two-year period for negotiating allowed by Article 50 that ended at the latest on 29 March 2019 if the UK had not by then ratified a withdrawal agreement or agreed a prolongation of the negotiating period..\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act which became law in June 2018 allowed for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. It authorises the government to bring into force, by order made under section 25, the provisions that fixed exit day and the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972, but exit day must be the same day and time as when the EU Treaties ceased to apply to the UK..\\\\c\\\\cExit day was the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11.00 p.m. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by a British Statutory Instrument on 11 April 2019), in section 20 (1), defined \\\\exit day\\\\ as 11:00 p.m. on 31 October 2019. Originally, \\\\exit day\\\\ was defined as 11:00 p.m. on 29 March 2019 GMT (UTC+0)..\\\\c\\\\cA report published in March 2017 by the Institute for Government commented that, in addition to the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, primary and secondary legislation will be needed to cover the gaps in policy areas such as customs, immigration and agriculture. The report also commented that the role of the devolved legislatures was unclear, and could cause problems, and as many as 15 new additional Brexit Bills may be required, which would involve strict prioritisation and limiting Parliamentary time for in-depth examination of new legislation..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2016 and 2017, the House of Lords published a series of reports on Brexit-related subjects, including:.\\\\c\\\\cThe Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018, relating to withdrawal from Euratom, was presented to Parliament in October 2017. The act makes provision about nuclear safeguards, and for connected.\\\\c\\\\cpurposes. The Secretary of State may by regulations (nuclear safeguards regulations) make provision for the purpose of â (a) ensuring that qualifying nuclear material, facilities or.\\\\c\\\\cequipment are available only for use for civil activities (whether in the UK or elsewhere), or (b) giving effect to provisions of a relevant international agreement..\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling overall showed an initial fall in support for Brexit from the referendum to late 2016, when responses were split evenly between support and opposition. Support rose again to a plurality, which held until the 2017 general election. Since then, opinion polls tended to show a plurality of support for remaining in the EU or for the view that Brexit was a mistake, with the estimated margin increasing until a small decrease in 2019 (to 53% Remain : 47% Leave, as of October 2019[update]). This seems to be largely due to a preference for remaining in the EU among those who did not vote in 2016\\\\s referendum (an estimated 2.5 million of whom, as of October 2019[update], were too young to vote at the time). Other reasons suggested include slightly more Leave voters than Remain voters (14% and 12% of each, respectively, as of October 2019[update]) changing how they would vote (particularly in Labour areas) and the deaths of older voters, most of whom voted to leave the EU..\\\\c\\\\cOne estimate of demographic changes (ignoring other effects) implies that had an EU referendum taken place in October 2019,[update] there would have been between 800,000 and 900,000 fewer Leave voters and between 600,000 and 700,000 more Remain voters, resulting in a Remain majority..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2019, a petition submitted to the British Parliament petitions website, calling on the government to revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU, reached a record-level of more than 6.1 million signatures..\\\\c\\\\cPost-referendum opinion polling.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK was right or wrong to vote to leave the EU.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, including Neither responses.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, excluding Neither responses and normalised.\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Brexit referendum, the Scottish Government â led by the Scottish National Party (SNP) â planned another independence referendum because Scotland voted to remain in the EU while England and Wales voted to leave. It had suggested this before the Brexit referendum. The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, requested a referendum be held before the UK\\\\s withdrawal, but the British Prime Minister rejected this timing. The Scottish Parliament voted in favour of holding another independence referendum, with Sturgeon planning it for 2021. At the referendum in 2014, 55% of voters had decided to remain in the UK, but the referendum on Britain\\\\s withdrawal from the EU was held in 2016, with 62% of Scottish voters against it. In the event that Northern Ireland remains associated with the EU â for example, by remaining in the Customs Union â it is expected that Scotland will also insist on special treatment..\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 March 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Scottish Continuity Bill. This was passed by stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court\\\\s judgement, designated itself under Schedule 4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament. The bill has therefore not received royal assent..\\\\c\\\\cOn 19 December 2018, the EU Commission revealed its no-deal Contingency Action Plan in specific sectors, in respect of the UK leaving the EU in 100 days\\\\ time..\\\\c\\\\cIn the wake of the United Kingdom\\\\s vote to leave the European Union, the Department for International Trade (DIT) for reaching and extending trade agreements between the UK and non-EU states was created by Prime Minister May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016. By 2017, it employed about 200 trade negotiators and was overseen by then Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox. In March 2019, the British government announced that it would cut many import tariffs to zero, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Confederation of British Industry said the move would be a sledgehammer for our economy, and the National Farmer\\\\s Union was also highly critical. Additionally, the plan appeared to breach standard WTO rules..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 June 2020, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel stated that the European Union must prepare for the possible failure of Brexit trade talks with the UK. She added that negotiations were being accelerated to try and reach a deal that could be ratified by the end of the year. Her warning came as the deadline for extending talks passed away, with negotiations expected to end on 31 December with or without a deal..\\\\c\\\\cThere has been litigation to explore the constitutional footings on which Brexit stands after R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (simply known as the Miller case) and the 2017 Notification Act:.\\\\c\\\\cIn R. (Webster) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, a Divisional Court of Gross LJ and Green MR determined that the substantive decision to leave the EU that was notified on 29 March 2017 was in fact the executive decision of the Prime Minister using a statutory power of decision found to have been delegated to her by the Notification Act: this is confirmed by the House of Commons Library commentary on the case. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal and paragraph 15 of the judgement, along with the citable nature of the decision were upheld.  While the case was criticised academically by Robert Craig, who lectures in jurisprudence at the London School of Economics, aspects of the case\\\\s analysis were supported by the Supreme Court in Miller 2 at paragraph 57, which confirmed that:.\\\\c\\\\cThis confirmation that the decision was an executive act was part of the basis of R. (Wilson) v. Prime Minister which allied this point with the concerns about the irregularities in the referendum.  The High Court hearing was on 7 December 2018 before Ouseley MJ and when judgement was given it was held that: courtsâ job was not to rule on irregularities in the âleaveâ campaign as these were not questions of law; it was also said that the case was brought both too early and too late. Judgement in the Court of Appeal (before Hickinbottom LJ and Haddon-Cave LJ) before also went against the applicant..\\\\c\\\\cRegarding the reversibility of a notification under Article 50, Wightman and others v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union was referred to Court of Justice of the European Union; the UK government sought to block this referral, taking the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court, but was unsuccessful. On 10 December 2018, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notification..\\\\c\\\\cMany effects of Brexit depended on whether the UK left with a withdrawal agreement, or before an agreement was ratified (no-deal Brexit). In 2017, the Financial Times said that there were approximately 759 international agreements, spanning 168 non-EU countries, that the UK would no longer be a party to upon leaving the EU..\\\\c\\\\cEconomists expect that Brexit will have damaging immediate and longer term effects on the economies of the UK and at least part of the EU27. In particular, there is a broad consensus among economists and in the economic literature that Brexit will likely reduce the UK\\\\s real per capita income in the medium and long term, and that the Brexit referendum itself damaged the economy. Studies found that Brexit-induced uncertainty reduced British GDP, British national income, investment by business, employment and British international trade from June 2016 onwards..\\\\c\\\\cA 2019 analysis found that British firms substantially increased offshoring to the EU after the Brexit referendum, whereas European firms reduced new investments in the UK. The British government\\\\s own Brexit analysis, leaked in January 2018, showed that British economic growth would be stunted by 2â8% over the 15 years following Brexit, the amount depending on the leave scenario. Economists warned that London\\\\s future as an international financial centre depended on passport agreements with the EU. Pro-Brexit activists and politicians have argued for negotiating trade and migration agreements with the CANZUK countriesâthose of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdomâbut economists have said that trade deals with those countries would be far less valuable to the UK than EU membership. Studies project that Brexit will exacerbate regional economic inequality in the UK, by hitting already-struggling regions the hardest..\\\\c\\\\cThe potential impact on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been a contentious issue. Since 2005, the border has been essentially invisible. After Brexit, it became the only UKâEU land border  (not counting the land border between the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar with Spain). All involved parties agree a hard border should be avoided, as it might compromise the Good Friday Agreement that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. To forestall this, the EU proposed a backstop agreement (the Northern Ireland Protocol) that would have kept the UK in the Customs Union and kept Northern Ireland in some aspects of the Single Market also, until a lasting solution was found. The backstop was part of the withdrawal agreement, but was replaced in the revised agreement..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit caused the European Union to lose its second-largest economy, its third-most populous country, and the second-largest net contributor to the EU budget. Brexit will result in an additional financial burden for the remaining net contributors, unless the budget is reduced accordingly. The UK will no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, where it has 16% of the shares. Analyses indicate that the departure of the relatively economically liberal UK will reduce the ability of remaining economically liberal countries to block measures in the Council of the EU. In 2019, ahead of Brexit, the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority moved their headquarters from London to Amsterdam and Paris, respectively..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which provides government financial support to farmers in the EU. The UK receives much less than it contributes. Brexit allows the UK to develop its own agriculture policy. The current UK government has committed to maintaining the same payments to farmers until the end of the current parliament, even without a withdrawal agreement. The Agriculture Bill is intended to replace the CAP with a new system. The UK will also leave the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) that lets all EU countries fish within 12 nautical miles of the British coast and lets the EU set catch quotas. The combined EU fishing fleets land about six million tonnes of fish per year, about half of which are from British waters. By leaving the CFP, the UK could develop its own fisheries policy. The UK will also leave the London Fisheries Convention that lets Irish, French, Belgian, Dutch and German vessels fish within six nautical miles of the UK\\\\s coast..\\\\c\\\\cGibraltar, a British Overseas Territory bordering Spain, will be affected by Brexit. Spain asserts a territorial claim on Gibraltar. After the referendum, Spain\\\\s Foreign Minister renewed calls for joint SpanishâBritish control. In late 2018, the British and Spanish governments agreed that any dispute over Gibraltar would not affect Brexit negotiations, and the British government agreed that UKâEU treaties made after Brexit would not automatically apply to Gibraltar..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit poses challenges to British academia and research, as the UK is likely to lose research funding from EU sources; see a reduction in students from the EU; find it harder to hire researchers from the EU; and British students will find it harder to study abroad in the EU. The UK is currently a member of the European Research Area and likely to wish to remain an associated member following Brexit. The British government has guaranteed funding for research currently funded by EU..\\\\c\\\\cAn early 2019 study found that Brexit would deplete the National Health Service (NHS) workforce, create uncertainties regarding care for British nationals living in the EU, and put at risk access to vaccines, equipment, and medicines. The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has taken steps to ensure the continuity of medical supplies after Brexit.  The number of non-British EU nurses registering with the NHS fell from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April 2017..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will have the final say over the laws that govern it. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, EU laws will no longer have supremacy over British laws after Brexit. To maintain continuity, the Act converts EU law into British law as retained EU law. After Brexit, the British parliament (and the devolved legislatures) can decide which elements of that law to keep, amend or repeal. Furthermore, British courts will no longer be bound by the judgments of the EU Court of Justice after Brexit..\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK would be able to control immigration from the EU and EEA, as it can end EU freedom of movement. The current British government intends to replace it with a new system. The government\\\\s 2018 white paper proposes a skills-based immigration system that prioritizes skilled migrants. EU and EEA citizens already living in the UK can continue living there after Brexit by applying to the EU Settlement Scheme, which began in March 2019. Irish citizens will not have to apply to the scheme. Studies estimate that Brexit and the end of free movement will likely result in a large decline in immigration from EEA countries to the UK. After Brexit, any foreigner wanting to do so more than temporarily would need a work permit..\\\\c\\\\cBy leaving the EU, the UK would leave the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA), a single market in commercial air travel, but could negotiate a number of different future relationships with the EU. British airlines would still have permission to operate within the EU with no restrictions, and vice versa. The British government seeks continued participation in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The UK has its own air service agreements with 111 countries, which permit flights to-and-from the country, and further 17 countries through its EU membership. These have since been replaced. Ferries will continue, but with obstacles such as customs checks. New ferry departures between the Republic of Ireland and the European mainland have been established. As of August 2020[update], the government\\\\s Goods Vehicle Movement Service, an IT system essential to post-Brexit goods movements, was still only in the early stages of beta testing, with four months to go before it is required to be in operation..\\\\c\\\\cConcerns have been raised that Brexit might create security problems for the UK, particularly in law enforcement and counter-terrorism where the UK could use the EU\\\\s databases on individuals crossing the British border..\\\\c\\\\cBrexit has inspired many creative works, such as murals, sculptures, novels, plays, movies and video games. The response of British artists and writers to Brexit has in general been negative, reflecting a reported overwhelming percentage of people involved in Britain\\\\s creative industries voting against leaving the European Union. Despite issues around immigration being central in the Brexit debate, British artists left the migrants\\\\ perspective largely unexplored. However, Brexit also inspired UK-based migrant artists to create new works and claim agency over their representation within public spaces and create a platform for a new social imagination that can facilitate transnational and trans-local encounters, multicultural democratic spaces, sense of commonality, and solidarity.\\\\c\\\\cAnti-Brexit protest in Manchester (2017) by sculptor Jacques Tilly.\\\\c\\\\cDuÌsseldorf carnival parade in February 2018 by German by sculptor Jacques Tilly.\\\\c\\\\cThe United Kingdom says that it has requested to respond to a European Union notification of intent to start legal proceedings over the UK\\\\s alleged breaching of the Northern Ireland Protocol by mid-May. The UK says that its unilateral delay of the introduction of new Irish Sea border checks on food, parcels and pets is lawful.\\n',\n"," 'On March 29, 2021, Adam Toledo, a 13-year-old Mexican American boy, was fatally shot by Chicago Police Department officer Eric Stillman in the Little Village neighborhood on the West Side of Chicago. Bodycam footage of the shooting was released publicly on April 15..\\\\c\\\\cAdam Toledo was a seventh-grader at Gary Elementary School from the Little Village neighborhood in Chicago. He was 13 years old when the incident occurred..\\\\c\\\\cRuben Roman is a 21-year-old arrested by the Chicago PD at the scene..\\\\c\\\\cEric Stillman is the 34-year-old officer who killed Toledo. He was placed on administrative leave for 30 days following the incident.  Originally, police said Stillman had no complaints on his record. According to the organization that runs the police database however, he had three complaints and four use of force reports on his record at the time of the shooting..\\\\c\\\\cProsecutors alleged that at around 2:30 a.m., Toledo and Roman were walking toward 24th Street when Roman fired multiple rounds as a vehicle passed. Police ShotSpotter detector technology registered shots fired and a squad car arrived at the scene. According to prosecutors\\\\ initial claims, Toledo ran away from the officers, was chased into an alleyway, turned back to the officer with a gun in his hand, and was then shot in the chest. The police claimed a handgun was recovered at the scene from behind a fence after an armed confrontation..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 15, 2021, however, the released body cam footage of Toledoâs shooting showed he was unarmed at the moment of the shooting. The video shows the officer chasing Toledo into the alleyway, where Toledo slows down and stops. In footage taken from another angle, it appears that he tosses a weapon away, over a fence. The officer points a strobe flashlight at him and yells Show me your fucking hands. Toledo then turns around with his hands up. As he does so, the officer yells drop it, and Toledo is shot by the officer. Toledo was not holding a gun when he was shot, but it is uncertain if he was armed in the moments leading up to being shot..\\\\c\\\\cAfter shooting Toledo, officer Stillman calls for medical assistance and begins to perform CPR..\\\\c\\\\cChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has called for reforms to how police pursue individuals on foot and called for a thorough, expeditious investigation. Officials have said they are in the very early stages of interviewing witnesses and officers..\\\\c\\\\cIn the lead up to the release of the body cam footage, all Chicago police officers\\\\ days off were cancelled to ensure public safety. During the press conference releasing the body cam footage, Mayor Lightfoot also stated that the city would be putting into place plans to prepare for unrest..\\\\c\\\\cToledo is believed to be the youngest person killed by the Chicago Police Department in several decades..\\\\c\\\\cProtests have occurred in Chicago in the days following Toledo\\\\s death..\\\\c\\\\cColumnist Eric Zorn wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune saying it was too early to say with confidence what happened and thus Toledo should not be portrayed as a martyr until more facts come out. His comments were received with outrage. Days later in another op-ed, Zorn wrote that the less supportive response ... took fair exception to my chilly, analytical tone ... I regret that tone. In focusing on details and marshaling evidence and arguments, I can neglect the emotional resonance in situations, as though I\\\\ve forgotten or don\\\\t care that a child who was loved has died, and that the death of someone with so much life ahead of him is always, always a tragedy. I should have done better..\\\\c\\\\cThe writer Roxanne Gay said, The Adam Toledo video was so horrifying that Chicago boarded up municipal buildings before the video was released. That tells you all you need to know..\\\\c\\\\cThe journalist Maria Hinojosa stated, Adam Toledo was a child. Not a threat..\\\\c\\\\cCongressman Joaquin Castro wrote on Twitter, Adam Toledo was 13-years-old. He complied and had his hands up. Chicago police killed him with a shot to the chest and then lied that he posed an imminent threat. The Toledo family deserves justice and accountability. His brother, former-Secretary Julian Castro, wrote, Chicago PD shot Adam Toledo with his hands in the air instantaneously after ordering him to do soâthen lied about it. They executed Adam, a boy who was not yet in high school. Indict this officer, then pass a national use of force standard immediately..\\\\c\\\\cSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote, Adam Toledo was just 13 years old. He was a child. He deserves justice. His family deserves justice..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 1, 2021, Chicago Police Department alerted its officers that Latin Kings ranked members were instructed to open fire at unmarked police cruisers to retaliate for the shooting of Adam Toledo. The warning was prioritized to officers in Little Village, between Lawndale Avenue and Whipple Street..\\\\c\\\\cSeveral protests take place around the city after the video is released, including one that briefly shut down northbound Michigan Avenue and another at Union Park.\\n',\n"," 'The GazaâIsrael conflict is a part of the localized IsraeliâPalestinian conflict, but is also a scene of power struggle between regional powers including Egypt, Iran and Turkey together with Qatar, supporting different sides of the conflict in light of the regional standoff between Iran and Saudi Arabia on one hand and between Qatar and Saudi Arabia on the other, as well as crisis in Egyptian-Turkish relations..\\\\c\\\\cThe conflict originated with the election of the Islamist political party Hamas in 2005 and 2006 in the Gaza Strip and escalated with the split of the Palestinian Authority Palestinian government into the Fatah government in the West Bank  and the Hamas government in Gaza and the following violent ousting of Fatah after Fatah lost the election to Hamas. Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, and the joint Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza have exacerbated the conflict. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets illegal under international law..\\\\c\\\\cAs part of its 2005 disengagement plan, Israel retained exclusive control over Gaza\\\\s airspace and territorial waters, continued to patrol and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of its southernmost border (where Egypt retained control of the border and border crossings were supervised by European monitors) and continued to monitor and blockade Gaza\\\\s coastline. Israel largely provides and controls Gaza\\\\s water supply, electricity and communications infrastructure.  According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Israel remains an occupying power under international law. The United Nations has stated that under resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, it regards Gaza to be part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Meanwhile, the Fatah government in the West Bank, internationally recognized as the sole representative of the State of Palestine, refers to the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian state and does not recognize the Hamas government..\\\\c\\\\cThe IsraelâGaza barrier, completed in 1996, has helped reduce infiltration from Gaza Strip into Israel.[citation needed] Since the beginning of the Second Intifada, Gazans have not been permitted to enter Israel for work purposes. Special permits to enter Israel for medical purposes were also greatly reduced,[citation needed] which has made travel for Palestinians difficult..\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Schueftan, in his 1999 book, Disengagement: Israel and the Palestinian Entity (The Need for Separation: Israel and the Palestinian Authority) reviews new and existing arguments underlying different separation stances, in order to make the case for separation from the Palestinians, beginning with those in the West Bank and Gaza. Schueftan favors the hard separation stances of politicians like Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak..\\\\c\\\\cYitzhak Rabin was the first to propose the creation of a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations in 1992, and by 1994, construction on the first barrier â the IsraelâGaza barrier â had begun; it is actually a wire fence equipped with sensors. Following an attack on Bet Lid, near the city of Netanya, Rabin specified the objectives behind the undertaking, stating that:.\\\\c\\\\cThe Second Intifada, also known as the al-Aqsa Intifada, began in September 2000. Many Palestinians consider the Intifada to be a struggle of national liberation against Israeli occupation imposed on them following the 1967 War, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cPalestinian tactics have ranged from carrying out mass protests and general strikes, as in the First Intifada, to mounting suicide bombing attacks and firing Qassam rockets into east southern Israeli residential areas. Israeli tactics range from conducting mass arrests and locking up Palestinians in administrative detention through setting up checkpoints and building the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier and West Bank barrier to carrying out assassinations targeting militants and leaders of Palestinian organizations..\\\\c\\\\cSince the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Israel has been negotiating with Mahmoud Abbas and the PLO, but has been simultaneously targeting and bombing Hamas activists and militants and arresting Hamas\\\\s elected legislative counsel politicians..\\\\c\\\\cThe death toll, both military and civilian, over the entire period in question (2000â2007) is estimated to be over 4,300 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis. To date, 64 foreign citizens have also been killed (54 by Palestinians, and 10 by Israeli security forces)..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael implemented its Disengagement Plan in AugustâSeptember 2005, withdrawing its civilian and military presence from the Gaza Strip, and retaining control over the Gaza airspace, maritime access and borders even with Egypt according to the 2005 agreement with Palestinian authority. Qassam rockets were fired regularly prior to the Israeli disengagement and the frequency of Qassam attacks increased after the Disengagement from Gaza. Palestinian militants have targeted a number of military bases and civilian towns in Southern Israel..\\\\c\\\\cSince 2001, Palestinian militants have launched thousands of rocket and mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip. Thirteen Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured as a result of Qassam rocket fire at Israeli targets. Additionally, Qassam rocket attacks have resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in both children and adults, with 33% of children living in Sderot suffering from PTSD..\\\\c\\\\cWhen the Islamic party Hamas won the January 2006 Palestinian legislative election, gaining a majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, the conflict between Israel and Gaza intensified. Israel sealed its border with the Gaza Strip, largely preventing free flow of people and many imports and exports. Palestinians have been shooting Qassam rockets at Israeli settlements located near the Gaza borders, and have staged cross-border raids aimed at killing or capturing Israeli soldiers. In one such raid, on 25 June 2006, Palestinians captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, leading to massive retaliation by the Israeli army which included air strikes against Hamas targets..\\\\c\\\\cIn June 2007, internal fighting broke out between Hamas and Fatah and Hamas fully consolidated its power by staging an armed coup d\\\\eÌtat and taking control of the Gaza Strip.  Following the internecine fighting that occurred between 7 and 15 June 2007, also known as the Battle of Gaza 2007 in which 118 Palestinians were killed and over 550 were wounded, the entire Gaza Strip came under full control of a Hamas government..\\\\c\\\\cAs a response to the Hamas takeover, Israel sharply restricted the flow of people and goods into and out of Gaza. About 70% of Gaza\\\\s workforce have become unemployed or without pay, and about 80% of its residents live in poverty..\\\\c\\\\cSince Hamas\\\\ takeover, Palestinian armed groups in Gaza and Israel continued to clash. Palestinian armed groups have fired rockets into Israel, killing Israeli civilians, including children, and wounding others, as well as causing damage to infrastructure; and Israel have launched attacks, and shelled Gaza with artillery, killing Palestinian combatants as well as civilians, including children, and causing devastating damage to infrastructure. According to Human Rights Watch, the Palestinian deliberate attacks against civilians violate international humanitarian law. Because Hamas exercises power inside Gaza, it is responsible for stopping unlawful attacks even when carried out by other groups..\\\\c\\\\cLarge-scale conventional warfare beyond the peripheries of the Gaza Strip began when Palestinian militants abducted Corporal Gilad Shalit, and Israel responded by launching Operation Summer Rains on 28 June 2006. The operation became the first major mobilization within the Gaza Strip since Israel unilaterally disengaged from the region between August and September 2005..\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza beach blast was an event on 9 June 2006 in which eight Palestinians were killed â including nearly the entire family of seven-year-old Huda Ghaliya â and at least thirty others were injured in an explosion on a beach near the municipality of Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip. The incident received considerable attention from news media worldwide, with blame for the explosion hotly disputed in the following weeks..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael maintains that it mobilized thousands of troops in order to suppress Qassam rocket fire against its civilian population and to secure the release of Gilad Shalit. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 9,000 Israeli artillery shells were fired into Gaza between September 2005 and June 2006, killing 80 Palestinians in 6 months. On the Palestinian side, over 1,300 Qassam rockets have been fired into Israel from September 2000 to 21 December 2006.[citation needed] Israeli forces also continued to search for tunnels, used by militants to smuggle weapons, as well as monitor operations at checkpoints (with some assistance from the European Union at Rafah) for security reasons, specifically possible weapons transfers and uninhibited return of exiled extremist leaders and terrorists. As of 18 October 2006, Israel has discovered 20 tunnels used for illegal arms smuggling under the border of the Gaza Strip and Egypt..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael had said it would withdraw from the Strip and end the operation as soon as Shalit was released. The Palestinians had said that they were willing to return Shalit in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The Palestinians and others have also said the assault was aimed at toppling the democratically elected Hamas-led government and at destabilizing the Palestinian National Authority, citing the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as a power station and the captures of government and parliament members. Some 300 Palestinians had been targeted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit..\\\\c\\\\cIn July 2006, first reports emerged about mystery injuries after Israeli attacks. Previously unseen injuries included severely damaged internal organs, severe internal burning and deep internal wounds often resulting in amputations or death. Bodies arrived severely fragmented, melted and disfigured. There were speculations about a new experimental weapon, particularly Dense Inert Metal Explosives (DIMEs)..\\\\c\\\\cAttempting to curb Qassam rocket attacks fired at Southern Israel by Palestinian militants from the northern Gaza Strip,.\\\\c\\\\cIsrael launched Operation Autumn Clouds on 1 November 2006..\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 November 2006, a day after Israel\\\\s withdrawal following Operation Autumn Clouds, Israel Defense Forces shells missed their targetâpossibly due to a technical malfunctionâand hit a row of houses in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, killing 19 Palestinians and wounding more than 40. Israeli Defense Forces launched an investigation into the Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident (and later apologized for the incident), and the then Israeli President Ehud Olmert offered humanitarian assistance to those affected..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2006 FrancoâItalianâSpanish Middle East Peace Plan was proposed after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in Operation Autumn Clouds by Spanish Premier JoseÌ Luis RodriÌguez Zapatero during talks with French president Jacques Chirac. Italy\\\\s prime minister Romano Prodi gave his full support to the plan..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 November, a ceasefire was signed by Palestinian organisations and Israel, and Israel withdrew its troops while the Palestinian Authority forces deployed to stop Qassam rocket launchings. Following the truce over 60 Qassam rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip at Israel, and 1 Palestinian (armed with guns and grenades) was killed by the IDF. On 19 December, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad began taking open responsibility for the Qassam rocket firing, because they said Israel killed two of their members in Jenin..\\\\c\\\\cA series of battles between Palestinian militants in Hamas-governed Gaza and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that began in mid-May 2007, with the inter-Palestinian violence flaring in the meantime. Palestinians fired more than 220 Qassam rocket attacks on Israel (Sderot and the western Negev) in more than a week. The Israeli Air Force fired missiles and bombs at the launching sites. The fighting came amid serious Palestinian factional violence and reports of growing level of humanitarian crisis in the region. Hamas said they will continue to retaliate against Israeli strikes..\\\\c\\\\cIn September 2007, citing an intensification of Qassam rocket attacks, Israel declared Gaza hostile territory. The declaration allowed Israel to prevent the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into Gaza. The stated purpose of this blockade was to pressure Hamas into ending the rocket attacks and to deprive them of the supplies necessary for the continuation of rocket attacks. Israel\\\\s decision to cut fuel supplies to Gaza were widely condemned as collective punishment..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael has also arrested Hamas officials in the West Bank, including two cabinet members. Such arrests have been strongly condemned by international organizations and politicians..\\\\c\\\\cBy January 2008, according to a United Nations study, the economic effects of Israel\\\\s blockade on Gaza reached a critical threshold. Finally, on 17 January 2008, Israel sealed the border completely following a rise in rocket attacks. The breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January 2008, after gunmen in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah Border Crossing, destroying part of the former Israeli Gaza Strip barrier. The United Nations estimates that as many as half the 1.5 million population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 February 2008, Palestinian militants fired more than 40 Qassam rockets into southern Israel and the Israeli army fired three missiles at the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza destroying the building. On 28 February 2008 Israeli aircraft bombed a police station near the Gaza City home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, killing several children. The Israeli military says its air and ground operations against militants firing rockets from northern Gaza have hit at least 23 armed Palestinians, while Palestinian sources have reported higher death tolls and say many civilians have also been killed..\\\\c\\\\cIsrael began its air and ground operations on 29 February. The IDF\\\\s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 100 Palestinians in less than a week. Palestinians fired 150 rockets at Israel which killed three Israelis. The United States called for an end to clashes between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has accused Israel of international terrorism, saying its assault on Gaza constitutes more than a holocaust. On 3 March Abbas suspended all contact with Israel over its assault on Gaza as the Israeli government sent warplanes to hit more targets early on Monday and vowed to continue its offensive. The European Union condemned what it called disproportionate use of force by the Israeli military in Gaza after 54 Palestinians were killed in the highest casualty toll for a single day since fighting erupted in 2000. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also issued a condemnation of what he termed Israel\\\\s excessive and disproportionate response, and called on Israel to cease such attacks, while denouncing the ongoing rocket attacks on Sderot and Ashkelon. In the Muslim world, demonstrators took to the streets to protest the IDF attacks. Iran\\\\s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Muslims to rise up and their leaders to hit Israel in the face with their nations\\\\ anger. In Lebanon, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters gathered at the Fatima Gate at the border between Lebanon and Israel, shouting Death to Israel and waving Lebanese and Palestinian flags. In Egypt, thousands of students held protests at universities across the country calling on Arab leaders to stop Israeli aggression and support the Palestinians. Some protesters burned Israeli and American flags. About 10,000 protesters, mainly from Jordan\\\\s mainstream Muslim Brotherhood and smaller opposition groups, took to the streets in one of the country\\\\s most vocal and largest anti-Israeli demonstrations in recent years. Saudi Arabia meanwhile compared the IDF offensive to Nazi war crimes and called on the international community to stop what it called the mass killings of Palestinians. Turkey\\\\s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the IDF attacks can have no humanitarian justification and added that Israel was rejecting a diplomatic solution to the dispute. Most Israeli tanks and troops pulled out of northern Gaza 3 March 2008, and an Israel Defense Forces spokesman confirmed that the Israeli military was ending offensive operations there after five days..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 February 2008, the Israeli military launched Operation Hot Winter (also called Operation Warm Winter) in response to Qassam rockets fired from the Strip by Hamas. The Israeli army killed 112 Palestinians, and Palestinian militants killed three Israelis. More than 150 Palestinians and seven Israelis have been injured..\\\\c\\\\cThere was widespread international alarm at the scale of the operation, with the US state department encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life, and the European Union and the United Nations criticising Israel\\\\s disproportionate use of force. The European Union also demanded an immediate end to Palestinian militant rocket attacks on Israel and urged Israel to halt activities that endanger civilians, saying they were in violation of international law..\\\\c\\\\cThe 2008 IsraelâHamas ceasefire was an Egyptian-brokered six-month Tahdia (an Arabic term for a lull) for the Gaza area, which went into effect between Hamas and Israel on 19 June 2008. Hamas\\\\ obligation was to stop the rocket attacks on Israel. During the initial 5-months of the ceasefire, and after a shaky start during the initial week, these attacks from Gaza decreased significantly for a total of 19 rocket and 18 mortar shell launchings, compared to 1199 rockets and 1072 mortar shells in 2008 up to 19 June, a reduction of 98%.  Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister acknowledged that there were no Hamas rockets during the ceasefire before November the 4th. Israel\\\\s obligation was to cease attacks on Gaza and once the ceasefire held, to gradually begin to ease its punishing blockade of Gaza. The agreement called on Israel to increase the level of goods entering Gaza by 30 percent over the pre-lull period within 72 hours and to open all border crossings and allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza within 13 days after the beginning of the ceasefire.[better source needed] The increase in supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel did improve, but the increase was only to an average of about 20 percent of normal levels, compared to the Hamas compliance in reducing rocket fire by 98%. Two months later the volume of goods arriving was too low to significantly improved living conditions, preventing UNRWA from replenishing its stores. Israel told U.S. officials in 2008 it would keep Gaza\\\\s economy on the brink of collapse..\\\\c\\\\cOn 4 November 2008 Israel broke the ceasefire with an attack on Gaza. The Israeli military claimed the target of the raid was a tunnel that they said Hamas was planning to use to capture Israeli soldiers positioned on the border fence 250m away. Hamas officials differed, however, claiming that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes, not to capture IDF personnel, according to Dr Robert Pastor (of the Carter Institute), and an IDF official confirmed that fact to him. Hamas replied to the Israeli attack with a barrage of rocket fire. With this incursion into Gaza territory and its non-compliance with the easing of the embargo, Israel had failed to comply with two aspects of the June 2008 ceasefire..\\\\c\\\\cWhen the six-month truce officially expired on 19 December, Hamas launched 50 to more than 70 rockets and mortars into Israel over the next three days, though no Israelis were injured. On 21 December, Hamas said it was ready to stop the attacks and renew the truce if Israel stopped its aggression in Gaza and opened up its border crossings. On 27 and 28 December, Israel implemented Operation Cast Lead against Hamas. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said We warned Hamas repeatedly that rejecting the truce would push Israel to aggression against Gaza..\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza War started when Israel launched a large military campaign in the Gaza Strip on 27 December 2008, codenamed Operation Cast Lead (Hebrew: ×××¦×¢ ×¢××¤×¨×ª ××¦××§×), with the stated aim of stopping Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel and arms smuggling into Gaza. The conflict has also been called the Gaza massacre in the Arab world (Arabic: ÙØ¬Ø²Ø±Ø© ØºØ²Ø©). A fragile six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired on 19 December 2008. The Israeli operation began with an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas bases, police training camps, police headquarters and offices. Civilian infrastructure, including mosques, houses, medical facilities and schools, were also attacked, as Israel stated that many of them were used by combatants, and as storage spaces for weapons and rockets. Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against targets in Israel throughout the conflict, hitting previously untargeted cities such as Beersheba and Ashdod. On 3 January 2009, the Israeli ground invasion began. Human rights groups and aid organisations have accused Hamas and Israel of war crimes. An estimated 1,166-1,417 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in the conflict. The conflict came to an end on 18 January after first Israel and then Hamas announced unilateral ceasefires. On 21 January, Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. On 2 March, it was reported that international donors had pledged $4.5 billion in aid for the Palestinians, mainly for rebuilding Gaza after Israel\\\\s offensive. This war is considered to be the largest, devastating and deadliest military operation in Gaza since the Six-day war in 1967..\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 March 2010, two Israeli soldiers and two Hamas militants were killed during clashes on the Gaza Strip\\\\s southern border. Two other soldiers were wounded during the fighting which broke out east of the town of Khan Younis. They are the first Israeli soldiers to have been killed in hostile fire in or around Gaza since Israel\\\\s major offensive there in January 2009, according to the BBC..\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 August 2011, a series of cross-border attacks was carried out in southern Israel near the Egyptian border, by a squad of militants. The militants first opened fire at civilian bus. Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel\\\\s border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the second week of March 2012, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation Returning Echo. It was the worst outbreak of violence covered by the media in the region since the 2008â09 Operation Cast Lead (the Gaza War)..\\\\c\\\\cAttacks by Israel and Gazans grew intense late in October 2012. An Israeli air strike killed Ahmed Jabari, chief of the Hamas military wing in Gaza. During the operation, four Israeli civilians and one soldier were killed by Palestinian rocket fire, according to Palestinian Centre for Human Rights 158 Palestinians had been killed, of which: 102 were civilians, 55 militants and one was policeman. 30 children and 13 women were among the killed, while the Israel Defense Forces presented statistics showing that out of 177 Palestinians killed, 120 were militants.  Most of the fighting was by bombs, aerial attacks, artillery, and rockets; the rockets being primarily used by the Palestinians and air strikes primarily by the Israelis. Attacked locations include Beersheva, Tel Aviv, Ashdod, Ofakim, Gaza, the rest of the Gaza Strip, the Shaar Hanegev, and Eshkol Regional Council. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and other Western countries expressed support for Israel\\\\s right to defend itself, and/or[clarification needed] condemned the Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. Iran, Egypt, Turkey, North Korea and several other Arab and Muslim countries condemned the Israeli operation..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2014, fighting intensified between Israel and Hamas, leading to another full-scale Gaza War, this one far deadlier than the previous in 2008â2009. The IDF launched Operation Protective Edge on 8 July 2014, in response to Hamas rocket attacks, which were launched following an earlier Israeli air strike against Gaza and on 17 July 2014, Israel troops entered the Gaza Strip. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the conflict. The war came to an end after 50 days of conflict when a ceasefire was agreed upon on 26 August 2014..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 2018 Land Day protests, 168 Palestinians have been killed and thousands were injured during clashes with Israeli troops at the Gaza-Israel border..\\\\c\\\\cViolence flared up again on 11 November 2018 when seven Palestinian militants were killed during a botched raid by the Israel Defense Forces in the southeastern Gaza Strip. One IDF officer was killed and another was injured. Over a dozen rockets were subsequently fired from Gaza, three of which were shot down. After a series of intense fire exchanges, ceasefire was agreed upon on 13 November 2018..\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 March, seven people were injured in Israel after a rocket attack destroyed a home in Mishmeret. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that Hamas was responsible for the attack..\\\\c\\\\cThe Israeli Air Force sent jets to strike multiple targets in the Gaza Strip, including the office of senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh, and Hamas\\\\ military intelligence headquarters in Gaza City..\\\\c\\\\cOn 3 May, two Israeli soldiers were injured by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper from in the Gaza Strip during the weekly protests at the GazaâIsrael border. In response, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike, killing four Palestinians. In addition, two other Palestinians were killed and 60 wounded, 36 of them by Israeli gunfire..\\\\c\\\\cFollowing this, Gazan militants launched hundreds of rockets at Israel. In response, the Israeli Air Force struck numerous targets within the Gaza Strip. In addition, Israel increased its troop presence near the GazaâIsrael border..\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 July 2014 on the 23rd day of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict, Ireland\\\\s Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said he shared the horror and revulsion of senators and very many of our citizens at the horrendous scenes we have witnessed since the start of the Israeli military operation. The Irish government, he said, condemned both the unacceptably high civilian casualty rate resulting from disproportionate military action on Israel\\\\s part as well as the firing of rockets by Hamas and other militants into Israel. On 5 August 2014 a member of the British cabinet resigned over the UK government\\\\s approach to the 2014 conflict..\\\\c\\\\cPresidential campaigns of 2016, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Israel for its treatment of Gaza, and in particular criticized Netanyahu for overreacting and causing unnecessary civilian deaths. In April 2016 the Anti-Defamation League called on Sanders to withdraw remarks he made to the New York Daily News, which the ADL said exaggerated the death toll of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict. Sanders said over 10,000 innocent people were killed, a number far in excess of Palestinian or Israel sources\\\\ estimates. In response, Sanders said that he accepted a corrected number of the death toll as 2,300 in the course of the interview and that he would make every effort to set the record straight. The transcript of the interview failed to note that Sanders said Okay to the corrected number presented by the interviewer during the course of the interview..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to NGOs and the UN, the recent wars and the blockade have led to worsting living conditions in Gaza and could be become unlivable by 2020..\\\\c\\\\cDue to the conflict, Israel has stepped up its defense measures in the southern communities and cities of Israel. This includes building fortifications on existing structures and bomb shelters, developing an alarm system (Red Color) and building an air-defense system (Iron Dome) .\\\\c\\\\cIsraeli Air Force jets and helicopters strike Hamas-linked targets in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for earlier rocket fire targeting southern Israel. The IDF says that an armaments production facility and a tunnel used to smuggle weapons were hit.\\n',\n"," 'On April 15, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Nine people were killed, including the gunman, 19-year-old former employee Brandon Scott Hole, who committed suicide. Four others were injured. Hole\\\\s motive remains unknown..\\\\c\\\\cThe FedEx facility where the shooting occurred is located in the southwestern part of the city, near Indianapolis International Airport. It is the company\\\\s second-busiest hub, with nearly 4,000 employees in total. The building is equipped with metal detectors and security turnstiles at its entrance requiring the employees to scan their FedEx badges. There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the shooting, and many of them were changing shifts or on dinner breaks..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt, the gunman entered the facility in a vehicle and, after exiting unprovoked, immediately began firing. Afterwards, the gunman entered the facility and began shooting again. The shooting lasted several minutes. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene shortly after 11:00 p.m. However, the shooter took his own life by that point..\\\\c\\\\cThe shooting resulted in a brief closure of Interstate 70 at Ameriplex Parkway, which reopened shortly afterwards..\\\\c\\\\cThere were nine fatalities in the shooting, including the gunman. Excluding the gunman, four victims were found dead outside of the facility, with the other four being found dead inside. Five people were taken to the hospital, including one in critical condition; four of them suffered gunshot wounds..\\\\c\\\\cPolice identified the gunman as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old resident of Indiana who had been employed at the Indianapolis facility until 2020. After the shooting, authorities conducted a search of his home and seized evidence, including electronics..\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2020, Hole\\\\s mother contacted the FBI and local authorities and warned them about her son\\\\s intent to commit suicide by cop, prompting a preliminary investigation to be opened. Hole was placed in a temporary mental health hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. They seized a shotgun from him, and the FBI questioned Hole about unspecified items found in his bedroom in April 2020. Eventually, the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence of any criminal violation, and the shotgun was not returned to Hole. Previously, in 2013, local police contacted Hole for unclear reasons..\\\\c\\\\cOn April 16, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff.

The suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen, which was founded by two of the suspects. Six of the suspects were charged in federal court, while the other seven were charged with state crimes. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court.\\\\c\\\\cPreceding the 2020 United States elections, law enforcement officials, members of Congress, and groups tracking extremism in the country have warned about the increasing threat potential from militia and far-right groups. The Anti-Defamation League identified Michigan as a state where the modern militia movement found its roots and where a number of militia groups remain active. However, Jon Lewis, a research fellow at the Program on Extremism at George Washington University, said the Wolverine Watchmen group, which the suspects were members of, flew under the radar, adding, This is simply not a big group that we\\\\d ever heard of.\\\\c\\\\cThe alleged plot to kidnap Governor Gretchen Whitmer developed from June through September. Within the week preceding the Wolverine Watchmen arrests, there were at least three other state and federal arrest operations linked to the Boogaloo movement, of which the Wolverine Watchmen group\\\\s ideology adhered to.\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer, the main target of the plot, had seen her political profile elevated over the preceding months due to her early response to the outbreak of COVID-19 in Michigan, in which she enacted strict mitigation measures such as a lockdown of the state, which she was widely praised for. However, she also became a target of criticism from far-right groups, and her measures triggered protests in April and May, including one in which armed protesters stormed the Michigan State Capitol. President Donald Trump had offered his support for the protests, derisively calling Whitmer that woman from Michigan and tweeting on April 17: LIBERATE MICHIGAN!\\\\c\\\\cUltimately, on October 2, 2020, the Michigan Supreme Court made two rulings in response to the measures: a 4â3 ruling that declared a 1945 law allowing Whitmer to enact the measures was unconstitutional, and a unanimous ruling that declared a 1976 act did not give Whitmer the power to enact the measures without legislative approval. This put uncertainty over enforcement of the measures and forced the Michigan Department of Health and Human Services â and later, the Michigan Occupational Safety and Health Administration â to circumvent it by ordering similar measures, even after the alleged plot was made public.\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects were tied to a paramilitary militia group that called themselves the Wolverine Watchmen. The group was co-founded by suspects Pete Musico and Joseph Morrison; the latter is considered the group\\\\s commander. An NBC News investigation into the suspects\\\\ social media profiles found links between their ideologies and those of the broader boogaloo movement. The Wolverine Watchmen group had been recruiting members on Facebook from November 2019 until June 2020, when Facebook began purging all boogaloo-related material.\\\\c\\\\cThe suspects named in the federal indictment, charged with conspiracy to commit kidnapping, were Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta. Five of the men were Michigan residents, while the sixth, Croft, was from Delaware. Adam Fox and Barry Croft were accused of being the ringleaders of the plot. The suspects charged with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership, were Wolverine Watchmen founders Musico and Morrison, along with Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar. At least four of the 13 suspects had attended prior rallies at the Michigan State Capitol. On October 15, a fourteenth suspect, Brian Higgins of Wisconsin, was charged at the state level with material support of an act of terrorism. Garbin pleaded guilty on January 27, 2021 and agreed to testify against his five alleged co-conspirators.\\\\c\\\\cMorrison is considered the leader of the Wolverine Watchmen. His home in Munith, which he shared with Musico, was allegedly used as a training site, according to Michigan Assistant Attorney General Gregory Townsend. Photographs of the home show a Confederate battle flag and a variation of the U.S. flag with alternating, vertical red and white stripes and a circle of stars surrounding the words Liberty or Death. Morrison\\\\s neighbors told The Daily Beast that the home\\\\s residents were disrespectful and said large groups regularly gathered there on weekends, whereupon gunfire would be heard. His online alias was Boogaloo Bunyan. Morrison had served in the U.S. Marine Corps since 2015, most recently with the 4th Marine Logistics Group in Battle Creek, Michigan, with the rank of lance corporal; he was discharged from the Marine Corps Reserve on October 8, the same day as his arrest, for reasons unrelated to the criminal charges.\\\\c\\\\cAdam Fox, the alleged mastermind of the plot, was born Adam Waggoner but changed his last name to his mother\\\\s maiden name in 2014. He had been living in the basement of his former employer, a vacuum repair shop in Grand Rapids. Fox received permission for that living arrangement from the shop\\\\s owner who felt empathy towards Fox, as Fox was homeless and had dogs. The basement was allegedly used to hold one of the group\\\\s meetings. Fox posted a YouTube video in June, mentioning Whitmer\\\\s handling of the pandemic as one of his motives for the plot. According to his employer, Fox espoused anti-police and anti-government views, along with support for the boogaloo movement, and had recently become worried about the U.S. becoming a communist country and Democratic politicians taking away his guns. Fox had previously been a member of another militia group called the Michigan Home Guard, but he was kicked out due to rage issues and threatening other members on social media.\\\\c\\\\cTy Garbin was raised in Wyandotte but had been living in a manufactured home park in eastern Livingston County at the time of his arrest. His father is an Army veteran. Garbin was a licensed aircraft mechanic and had previously worked for SkyWest Airlines. He met Fox at a Second Amendment rally in Lansing. Garbin allegedly cased the governor\\\\s vacation home at night, texted about blowing up a bridge to slow police down, offered to paint his boat for night fishing as part of the kidnapping mission on the lake, and had the ability to manufacture guns. His lawyer mentioned he had no criminal record.\\\\c\\\\cBarry Croft regularly posted violent messages on his social media accounts. These accounts depicted him wearing a tricorne and a sweatshirt with an insignia associated with the Three Percenters militia group; he was later identified as the second-in-command of its Wisconsin branch. The FBI identified him as a national leader of the organization in January 2021. He expressed support for the Russia investigation origins counter-narrative and opposition to the country\\\\s current immigration policy, and he believed the investigations into President Trump constituted an uprising. However, he also included Trump\\\\s name in a grievance-filled hit-list of politicians that he wanted to hang, which he posted on Facebook in late June. He was living in Bear, Delaware, at the time of his arrest. Croft was arrested multiple times from 1994 to 1996 for assault and burglary. He was convicted in 1997 for possessing a gun in the commission of a felony and spent three years in prison. In April 2019, Croft was pardoned for the conviction, as well as the prior assault and burglary charges, by Delaware Governor John Carney. According to recordings of the alleged plotters, Croft claimed he had been granted permission from God to commit murder.\\\\c\\\\cKaleb Franks had allegedly spent $4,000 on equipment during the planning, including a helmet and night-vision goggles. He also allegedly brought a rifle with a silencer to one of the training exercises. According to his LinkedIn profile, he studied clinical psychology at Washtenaw Community College and was employed as a peer recovery coach at an addiction treatment center in Waterford. He had previously battled an addiction to heroin but has been sober since 2013, according to his lawyer. He was convicted in 2011 for cocaine possession and in 2013 for second-degree home invasion. He served nine months in jail and two years under the jurisdiction of drug courts.\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Harris served in the U.S. Marine Corps as a rifleman from 2014 to June 2019, most recently at Marine Corps Base Camp Lejeune in Jacksonville, North Carolina. Harris had been deployed to Japan and had reached the rank of corporal. He was awarded the Humanitarian Service Medal, the Marine Corps Good Conduct Medal, and the Global War on Terrorism Service Medal. He worked as a security guard at two different companies after being discharged. In June, he attended a Black Lives Matter rally in his hometown of Lake Orion and was interviewed by a local newspaper, where he said he was upset about the killing of George Floyd and police violence. The group allegedly met at his home on August 23 to discuss the plot.\\\\c\\\\cBrandon Caserta was depicted wearing a Hawaiian-style shirt associated with the boogaloo movement in a TikTok video; and on Facebook, he praised Kyle Rittenhouse, a civilian who shot three protesters, killing two, during unrest in Kenosha, Wisconsin, in August. Caserta was also a COVID-19 denier and supported the QAnon conspiracy theory; however, in one video, he criticized President Trump and called him a tyrant. His belief system apparently became more extreme following Whitmer\\\\s implementation of the statewide lockdown. His social media activity originally consisted of posts about comedy shows and podcasts, motivational quotes, and selfies; but following the lockdown, he began liking posts about conspiracy theories regarding Bill Gates, as well as memes about hogtying police officers.\\\\c\\\\cPete Musico was active on YouTube, where he posted video blogs against taxes, gun control, and the so-called deep state. A video posted in 2019, entitled Gretchen Whitmer Interview, depicted him railing against her policies around automobile ownership and promised he would interview Whitmer in person in a later video. Musico was also active on Gab, where he promoted the unfounded claim that there is an ongoing campaign to kill white people in South Africa. He also followed the accounts of Proud Boys organizer Joe Biggs and InfoWars personality Owen Shroyer. On Twitter, he expressed support for Trump and conspiracy theories regarding Bill and Hillary Clinton, and the high presence of mercury in vaccines. Musico\\\\s attorney said he was eventually kicked out of the Wolverine Watchmen because he was too soft and wouldn\\\\t commit to violence.\\\\c\\\\cShawn Fix had allegedly hosted Wolverine Watchmen meetings at his home in Belleville to discuss the plot. The house\\\\s yard had Donald Trump presidential campaign signs and a Gadsden flag. He was working as a truck driver and had more than a dozen driving infractions from 2007 to 2018. Fix had been charged with assault and battery and aggravated assault in 2012, but the victim dropped the charges in 2013.\\\\c\\\\cEric Molitor had posted support of the boogaloo movement on his Facebook profile. He also spoke positively about Kyle Rittenhouse and the St. Louis gun-toting controversy, along with anti-government sentiment. He had worked for a company that provides respiratory and ballistic protection to the military and first responders. In January 2020, he gave the Wexford County Commission a proposal to make it a Second Amendment sanctuary county, which passed unanimously the next month.\\\\c\\\\cMichael and William Null, twin brothers, allegedly helped conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s vacation home. They were also former members of another militia group called Michigan Liberty Militia. They were photographed at a protest held by Michigan United for Liberty, a right-wing group protesting against Whitmer\\\\s COVID-19 lockdown orders, at the Michigan State Capitol on April 30. William also attended another anti-lockdown rally in May, as well as Black Lives Matter rallies in Grand Rapids and Flint, according to Barry County Sheriff Dar Leaf, though Leaf also said William vented about the movement. William was also photographed at a February 2017 protest against President Trump\\\\s Executive Order 13769, held by the Equality Caucus of Genesee County in Flint. He and members of the Michigan Liberty Militia were counter-protesting while wearing military fatigues, carrying firearms, and waving a Gadsden flag. William also allegedly made threats against the protesters on Facebook.\\\\c\\\\cPaul Bellar, who was arrested in Columbia, South Carolina, where he had moved from Milford over the summer after an eviction, was allegedly responsible for designing the tactical training exercises used by the Wolverine Watchmen, which included the use of firearms, medical treatment, and other tasks. Bellar\\\\s former neighbor in Milford said the pandemic caused Bellar to lose his job and called him a very angry person and said he threatened her with a gun after a run-in with him. According to Bellar\\\\s father, he trained for the U.S. Army at Fort Jackson for a year before being discharged in 2019 with a diagnosis of post-traumatic stress disorder.\\\\c\\\\cBrian Higgins was a resident of Wisconsin Dells, Wisconsin, when he was arrested on October 15. He is alleged to have provided his night-vision goggles and dashcam to help conduct surveillance on Whitmer\\\\s home.\\\\c\\\\cThe Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) reported that they became aware of group chats on social media in early 2020 threatening to conduct the violent overthrow of state governments and law enforcement. During the initial investigation of social media chats, the FBI said that they encountered Barry Croft and Adam Fox. In March 2020, local officers from an unidentified police department in Michigan reported to the FBI that the militia was seeking addresses of officers. The FBI then interviewed a militia member, who agreed to become a confidential source after they raised concerns that there were plans to kill police officers. On May 8, the FBI obtained a federal search warrant to review Croft\\\\s Facebook account. Agents found messages plotting potential acts of violence, including a May 3 post referencing a male individual who may be first and was wanted in custody; the FBI claims this individual was South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster.\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI subsequently began infiltrating the group online and in person with informants in June, according to a criminal complaint. Starting at that point, the FBI began compiling photographs, video footage, telephone calls, and encrypted messages made by the suspects and storing them as evidence on a USB flash drive. The content, said to consist of hundreds of hours of undercover audio recordings and more than 13,000 pages of encrypted text messages, was released by the U.S. District Court for the Western District of Michigan on October 16. On March 30, Pete Musico, a co-founder of the Wolverine Watchmen, allegedly made a comment about placing Whitmer under citizen\\\\s arrest and numerous other statements on tape that prosecutors later said had indicated a violent intent.\\\\c\\\\cIntentions by the group to obtain Whitmer\\\\s address reportedly went as far back as April 19, according to court records. On April 30, all members of the group attended an armed protest at the Michigan State Capitol, which prosecutors said was the beginning of opportunities to conduct surveillance. The plot was reportedly hatched in an official capacity on June 6, among a group of about a dozen individuals meeting in Dublin, Ohio, a suburb located northwest of Columbus. A confidential source at the meeting reported that the group primarily sought to establish a new, self-reliant society that adhered to the U.S. Bill of Rights. Participants reportedly discussed peaceful and violent actions of achieving this goal, with talks shifting to how state governments were allegedly violating the U.S. Constitution, how tyrants should be killed, and that those present should return home to recruit neighbors.\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Ohio meeting, Fox allegedly contacted the militia â already being investigated by the FBI â seeking assistance for the plot. On June 14, the militia held a field training exercise. That day, Fox contacted one confidential source in a recorded phone call, detailing the Ohio meeting, and he requested 200 men to attack the State Capitol in order to take Whitmer and others as hostages and to hold a trial for the governor, accusing her of treason. During the call, Fox reportedly said to the source that the operation had to occur prior to the 2020 United States presidential election.\\\\c\\\\cDuring a Second Amendment event at the State Capitol on June 18, Fox was recorded by a confidential source attempting to recruit militia group leaders to unite in an effort to attack the State Capitol. Two days later on June 20, Fox invited individuals, including one confidential source, to where he was employed in Grand Rapids. According to the source, Fox collected cellphones to prevent recordings and led participants through a trapdoor from the main floor, though the source wore a concealed recording device unknown to those gathered. Audio from the meeting provided to the FBI contained discussions of an assault on the Capitol, how to counterattack first responders, and the use of Molotov cocktails to destroy law enforcement vehicles. It was concluded that the group would meet on the first weekend of July, where they would discuss plans and perform training exercises.\\\\c\\\\cIn a June 25 Facebook video captured by the FBI, Fox held a livestream criticizing the justice system, the Government of Michigan and the state\\\\s order closing gyms, calling Whitmer a tyrant bitch and stating to viewers, I don\\\\t know, boys, we gotta do something. You guys link with me on our other location system, give me some ideas of what we can do.\\\\c\\\\cThe FBI alleges that training first occurred on June 28 in Munith, Michigan at a militia member\\\\s property, with Fox, his girlfriend, Ty Garbin, Kaleb Franks, Caserta, and a confidential source participating in the exercises. Participants were reportedly told to leave if they felt uncomfortable with attacking the government and participating in kidnapping. According to Musico\\\\s defense attorney, Fox started making comments about storming the State Capitol during this training session, but there was no agreement from the other members, and Musico expressed concern about the plan\\\\s tactical viability, saying, It\\\\s a fishbowl. Court documents released on November 13 alleged that in addition to storming the State Capitol, there were plans of executing hostages and televising them over the course of a week, or locking people inside the building, while the Legislature was in session, and setting it on fire with the intention of leaving no survivors.\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Musico\\\\s attorney, from that day to October 1, there was no activity from the Wolverine Watchmen due to a fight between Fox and Musico and Musico\\\\s eventual departure from the group. However, the FBI\\\\s confidential source for the investigation said that participants met for weapons exercises in Cambria, Wisconsin, between July 10 and 12, with Croft, Garbin, and a militia member attempting to make an improvised explosive device (IED) on July 11, though the device was defective. Franks also brought a rifle equipped with a silencer, firing it at the time.\\\\c\\\\cAt a second meeting in Ohio held on July 18, audio collected by a confidential source revealed discussions of attacking a Michigan State Police station, though Garbin rejected plans of an assault on the Capitol building, instead suggesting to attack Whitmer\\\\s family vacation home on Birch Lake in Elk Rapids. In a July 14 call recorded by a source, Fox said he researched the governor\\\\s office, concluding that Whitmer would not be present there and was heard saying, In all honesty right now ... I just wanna make the world glow, dude. I\\\\m not even fuckin\\\\ kidding. I just wanna make it all glow dude. I don\\\\t fuckin\\\\ care anymore, I\\\\m just so sick of it. That\\\\s what it\\\\s gonna take for us to take it back, we\\\\re just gonna have to everything\\\\s gonna have to be annihilated, man. We\\\\re gonna topple it all, dude. It\\\\s what great frickin\\\\ conquerors, man, we\\\\re just gonna conquer every fuckin\\\\ thing man. In a July 26 call with a confidential source, Fox said Maybe we should just make a bunch of cupcakes and send them out, with the source interpreting this as Fox seeking to initiate a widespread bombing campaign, according to the FBI.\\\\c\\\\cFox invited participants to his Grand Rapids location on July 27, where a confidential source provided recordings of discussions that shifted to kidnapping Whitmer when she was arriving at, or leaving, either her personal vacation home or the Michigan Governor\\\\s Summer Residence on Mackinac Island. According to the FBI, in sourced audio, Fox could be heard saying, Snatch and grab, man. Grab the fuckin\\\\ Governor. Just grab the bitch. Because at that point, we do that, dude -- it\\\\s over. Fox was also heard in the recording suggesting that the group hire a realtor to find Whitmer\\\\s exact residence, collecting information on the surrounding area and recruiting individuals skilled with information technology and demolitions.\\\\c\\\\cParticipants met in Munith a second time for training on August 9, and afterwards, they communicated via group calls and chats monitored by a confidential source. In these communications, Fox suggested researching the governor\\\\s residence in Lansing and destroying Whitmer\\\\s boat. Harris said in a chat, Have one person go to her house. Knock on the door and when she answers it just cap her ... at this point. Fuck it. I mean ... fuck, catch her walking into the building and act like a passers-by and fixing  [sic] dome her then yourself. During further chats on August 18, participants concentrated on finding the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home and planned on how to escape the area by boat.\\\\c\\\\cOn August 23, participants met at Harris\\\\ home in Lake Orion, where a secret recording was captured of the group discussing surveillance of the vacation home and Franks shared that he spent nearly $4,000 on night vision goggles and a helmet. A source captured audio of an August 29 surveillance operation, where Fox drove by the Whitmer family\\\\s vacation home, took photographs, and discussed response times of police in the area, with Fox allegedly heard saying, We ain\\\\t gonna let \\\\em burn our fuckin\\\\ state down. I don\\\\t give a fuck if there\\\\s only 20 or 30 of us, dude, we\\\\ll go out there and use deadly force. The next day on August 30, the FBI said screen captures of the group chat showed Garbin suggesting the demolition of a bridge near the vacation home to slow and distract police.\\\\c\\\\cDue to recommendation of the Michigan State Police and the Michigan Department of Technology, Management and Budget, the construction of a $1.1 million barrier and electric fence at the Michigan Governor\\\\s Mansion in Lansing was announced on September 4 after weeks of construction, with spokeswoman Tiffany Brown saying perimeter security and other safety upgrades were being performed. Regarding the security upgrades, The Detroit News wrote Whitmer, a Democrat who was first elected in 2018, has been the subject of menacing messages at Capitol demonstrations against her past COVID-19 stay-at-home orders, with the newspaper also citing other threats against Whitmer.\\\\c\\\\cWhile driving in three vehiclesâwith an undercover FBI agent and confidential source presentâfrom a group camp in Luther towards the vacation home on September 12 and early September 13, Croft allegedly suggested that the group attempt to kidnap Whitmer that night, though the idea was dismissed. According to the FBI, Croft and Fox, who were in the first vehicle, planned on detonating a bomb on a bridge of U.S. Route 31 in Elk Rapids, photographing the underside of the bridge, and deciding where to place explosives. The group in the first vehicle then drove to a boat launch across the lake from the vacation home, waiting for a second vehicle to conduct surveillance on the location. The third vehicle, which was also occupied by an undercover agent, was tasked with monitoring for any followers or suspicious activity in the area. On the way back to Garbin\\\\s property, the group discussed abandoning the kidnapping plan and instead destroying the vacation home entirely.\\\\c\\\\cAt a discussion recorded at Garbin\\\\s property on September 13, Fox said the plan would strictly be a kidnapping. An undercover agent told Fox that explosives for destroying the bridge leading to the lake would cost about $4,000. The group decided that a final training exercise would be conducted later in October, though Fox pushed for an earlier date the following day. On October 2, Fox told a confidential source that he purchased an 800,000-volt taser to be used for the kidnapping. That same month, he reportedly contacted Musico, who advocated for a nonviolent approach. Fox, Garbin, Harris, and Franks planned to meet with an undercover FBI agent to purchase explosives on October 7, though Caserta did not attend due to work obligations, while Croft returned to Delaware prior to the meeting.\\\\c\\\\cAll of the members involved were arrested on the night of October 7, and charges were filed against them the next day. Search warrants and arrests were executed all across Michigan. The arrests were reportedly part of a planned effort between federal and state authorities, launched after evidence was discovered indicating the suspects wanted to kidnap Whitmer before the 2020 election. At least seven FBI field offices, along with the operational divisions at the J. Edgar Hoover Building in Washington, D.C., were reportedly involved in coordinating the arrests. A week later, a fourteenth suspect was arrested and charged in state court. Several weapons and other items were seized, including at least 1,916 rounds of pistol, rifle, and shotgun ammunition; hundreds of firearms; extended magazines; various silencers; speedloaders; and bomb-making equipment.\\\\c\\\\cSix people (Adam Fox, Ty Garbin, Barry Croft, Kaleb Franks, Daniel Harris, and Brandon Caserta) were charged in the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan for conspiring to commit kidnapping. The federal charges carry an automatic sentence of life imprisonment if convictions are obtained. A federal judge said the federal government had probable cause in the cases against five of the defendants and declared they could move forward to trial, while also denying bond to four of them.\\\\c\\\\cDuring a court hearing on October 13, an FBI agent testified that the conspirators had considered leaving Whitmer in a boat in the middle of Lake Michigan and disabling its motor. He also testified that the group had discussed, during early stages of the planning, kidnapping Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also imposed strict lockdown orders in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. This prompted the FBI to notify members of Northam\\\\s security staff about the potential threat.\\\\c\\\\cOn October 26, federal prosecutors announced the FBI had found explosive device components and ghost guns and are considering adding federal terrorism charges after they are analyzed by experts. On October 28, an unsealed search warrant revealed that some of the defendants had discussed South Carolina Governor Henry McMaster as another possible target during the early stages of planning in March. The warrant also revealed that, in late June, Croft had posted on Facebook a hit-list of politicians that he said he wanted to hang. The list included the names of McMaster, President Trump, former Presidents Barack Obama and Bill Clinton, former U.S. State Secretary Hillary Clinton, New York Representative Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez, other Democratic and Republican elected officials, liberals, Muslims, and all anti-Americans.\\\\c\\\\cOn October 30, Franks\\\\s attorney requested a judge to reconsider her decision to keep him imprisoned, saying he is diabetic and fears contracting COVID-19 in jail.\\\\c\\\\cOn December 16, all six federal defendants were indicted by a grand jury.\\\\c\\\\cOn January 1, 2021, Croft, who remains jailed in a Philadelphia federal prison, asked to be released while he awaited his court hearings, due to the constant delays in a prisoner transfer and the subsequently slow progress of the case against him. Federal prosecutors argued against releasing him, describing Croft as a violent extremist and saying such a decision would be unreasonable.\\\\c\\\\cOn January 15, 2021, a judge ordered all six defendants to stand trial on March 23. The trial date was later postponed to October 12.\\\\c\\\\cOn January 27, 2021, Garbin pleaded guilty to conspiring to commit kidnapping. His sentencing is scheduled for July 8. As part of a plea bargain, he agreed to testify against his co-defendants in exchange for no additional charges being filed against him by prosecutors.\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel charged seven other men (Pete Musico, Joseph Morrison, Shawn Fix, Eric Molitor, Michael Null, William Null, and Paul Bellar) with state crimes, including providing material support for terrorist acts, firearm crimes, and gang membership. Two of the defendants were each set a bond of $10 million, with preliminary examinations scheduled for October 21. Musico\\\\s bond was later reduced to $100,000 after his attorney convinced the judge his role in the plot was overstated.\\\\c\\\\cOn October 20, Bellar was charged with state crimes and was extradited from his home state of South Carolina for a formal trial.\\\\c\\\\cOn November 10, Fix was released on a $250,000 bond. Three days later, bond was reduced for Morrison, Musico, and Bellar. Bellar was released on a $75,000 bond on November 13.\\\\c\\\\cOn October 15, Brian Higgins from Wisconsin was charged by Nessel with material support of an act of terrorism, which carries a 20-year sentence. On October 19, Higgins was released on bail, with one of the imposed restrictions being that he not try to make contact with the other 13 defendants. On November 18, his attorney announced his client\\\\s plans to challenge his extradition from Wisconsin to Michigan. The basis of the challenge was that the extradition paperwork was signed by Whitmer, the target of the alleged plot, thus creating a conflict of interest. On December 15, a judge in Columbia County, Wisconsin ruled there was enough probable cause for the transfer to occur. His extradition was delayed after his attorney filed an appeal on the ruling.\\\\c\\\\cOn December 4, twin brothers Michael and William Null were released on bond.\\\\c\\\\cOn December 18, a Jackson County judge denied a bond reduction request for Morrison, saying he could still pose a threat to the public.\\\\c\\\\cOn January 14, 2021, Molitor was released on bond.\\\\c\\\\cOn March 29, 2021, Morrison, Musico, and Bellar were bound over for trial after a three-day-long preliminary hearing. At the same hearing, threat of terrorism charges were dismissed against Morrison and Musico; Bellar did not face that charge.\\\\c\\\\cWhitmer spoke out during a livestream held after the thwarted plot was revealed by the FBI. She thanked the law enforcement agencies involved in the investigation, called the plotters sick and depraved men, and cast blame on President Trump for refusing to explicitly condemn far-right groups and for his handling of the COVID-19 pandemic. Whitmer later urged in a tweet that the suspects be called domestic terrorists and not members of any militia organization. In an October 11 interview with Face the Nation, she said security threats against her still existed and that extremists like the Wolverine Watchmen are finding comfort and support in the rhetoric coming out of Republican leadership from the White House to our state House. Whitmer wrote about the plot in an opinion piece in The Atlantic on October 27, where she continued to blame Trump\\\\s rhetoric for causing divisiveness in the country.\\\\c\\\\cMichigan Attorney General Dana Nessel called the plot one of the largest cases in recent history and labeled the case as rather unprecedented in nature. State Senator Mike Shirkey, Michigan House Speaker Lee Chatfield, and Ohio Governor Mike DeWine also condemned the plot. Chatfield later criticized Whitmer for not warning state lawmakers in advance about the plotters\\\\ original intent to storm the Michigan State Capitol building. Delaware Governor John Carney, who pardoned one of the suspects in 2019, called the federal charges disturbing and said, This is also another warning sign about the growing threat of violence and radicalization in our politics. Virginia Governor Ralph Northam, who had also been discussed by the alleged plotters as a potential target, declined to comment about the details of the plot but said he and his family felt safe with the protection of the Virginia State Police.\\\\c\\\\cIn an October 8 interview, President Trump criticized Whitmer for her rebuke of him in response to the kidnapping plot, saying he condemned all forms of extreme violence and calling for her to reopen her state. During that interview, Trump falsely claimed that Michigan\\\\s schools and churches were closed under Whitmer\\\\s orders. In response to Trump\\\\s remarks, Whitmer said it tells you everything you need to know about the difference between him and Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden. Biden also reacted to Trump\\\\s remarks on October 16, saying the failure to condemn these folks is stunning.\\\\c\\\\cTrump continued to attack Whitmer for her COVID-19 mitigation measures at a rally in Muskegon on October 17, which was matched with chants of Lock her up!, to which he replied, Lock \\\\em all up. Trump\\\\s daughter-in-law Lara, a campaign surrogate, later insisted he was merely having fun at the rally. In a subsequent interview with NBC\\\\s Meet the Press, Whitmer called Trump\\\\s rhetoric incredibly disturbing and said it is inspiring and incentivizing and inciting this kind of domestic terrorism. She also countered Trump\\\\s claims at the rally that she should relax the statewide COVID-19 restrictions, saying Michigan hasn\\\\t had a stay-at-home order since spring. At an October 27 rally in Lansing, Trump downplayed the alleged plot and continued the verbal attacks on Whitmer, which were also met with chants of Lock her up!.\\\\c\\\\cSince the kidnapping plot at one point involved an intended attack on police, state law enforcement agencies were put on high alert in response.\\\\c\\\\cDar Leaf, the elected sheriff of Barry County, Michigan, appeared to defend two of the suspects in an October 8 interview, saying that a lot of people are angry with the governor, and they want her arrested. So are they trying to arrest or was it a kidnap attempt? Because you can still in Michigan if it\\\\s a felony, make a felony arrest. Citing the state\\\\s citizen\\\\s arrest statute, he continued, It doesn\\\\t say if you are an elected office that you\\\\re exempt from that arrest. I have to look at it from that angle and I\\\\m hoping that\\\\s more what it is, in fact, these guys are innocent till proven guilty so I\\\\m not even sure if they had any part of it.\\\\c\\\\cThe interview went viral on the internet, along with the revelation that Leaf had shared the stage with one of the suspects at a May 18 anti-lockdown protest. Attorney General Nessel condemned the remarks as dangerous, while a number of other Michigan sheriffs expressed their outrage as well. Law experts disagreed with the notion that the Wolverine Watchmen were simply planning to conduct a legal citizen\\\\s arrest on Whitmer, saying it was far-fetched. Leaf later clarified his comments, claiming he simply wanted a fair trial for the accused and did not agree with their alleged actions, which he called horrible. His earlier comments and his ties with one of the suspects during the anti-lockdown protest have spurred calls for him to resign. On October 13, Leaf acknowledged the criticism but said he will not resign.\\\\c\\\\cDemocrats in the Michigan Legislature renewed calls for a ban on guns in the State Capitol building in response to news of the plot, following an unsuccessful September proposal drafted in response to armed anti-lockdown protesters storming the building in April.\\\\c\\\\cOn December 14, the day that Michigan\\\\s electors to the Electoral College were set to meet at the capital, authorities closed the Michigan State Capitol to the public and shuttered state legislators\\\\ offices in the wake of the alleged plot, following credible threats of violence. The building was left open only to those needed for the Electoral College. Earlier that day, State Representative Gary Eisen claimed there would be a Hail Mary effort regarding a plan to prevent electors from casting a vote. When asked if he can assure the public that it will be a safe day in Lansing, and that nobody would get hurt, Eisen replied, No. I don\\\\t know. Because what we\\\\re doing today is uncharted. Shortly after the interview, Chatfield and Speaker-Elect Jason Wentworth released a statement disavowing any threat of violence or intimidation and announcing Eisen would be removed from his committee assignments for the rest of the term.\\\\c\\\\cOn January 11, 2021, Michigan banned the open carry of firearms on the State Capitol, citing the alleged plot and the storming of the United States Capitol. The ban was supported by both Democratic and Republican state lawmakers. On January 15, 2021, the Michigan National Guard was requested, and heavy fencing was put up around the State Capitol, in preparation for an armed protest two days later, on January 17.\\\\c\\\\cA spokesperson for Facebook, which had been used by the suspects in plotting Whitmer\\\\s kidnapping, said the company would be cooperating with the FBI\\\\s investigation.\\\\c\\\\cA scheduled October 13 campaign stop by Eric Trump at a Lyon Township gun store was moved to a banquet center in Novi after it was discovered one of the suspects had worked there for three weeks before being fired.\\\\c\\\\cThe Wolverine Watchmen group was reportedly an offshoot of the Michigan Militia. The day after the suspects were arrested, the Michigan Militia issued a statement disavowing the group. Other Michigan-based militia groups also distanced themselves from the plotters\\\\ actions and intentions. The Michigan Home Guard, a militia that one of the suspects had once been a member of before being kicked out earlier this year, released a statement condemning the Wolverine Watchmen\\\\s actions.\\\\c\\\\cConspiracy theories about the alleged plot emerged on social media, falsely claiming the Wolverine Watchmen were anarchists affiliated with the antifa and Black Lives Matter movements. Some social media posts promoting the theories were flagged by Facebook as part of its anti-misinformation campaign, while PolitiFact rated the posts as Mostly False.\\\\c\\\\cA judge lifts the curfew and house arrest restrictions of two brothers who are suspected of plotting to kidnap Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer last year. However, they are still required to wear GPS tethers.',\n"," 'Brexit (/ËbrÉksÉªt, ËbrÉÉ¡zÉªt/; a portmanteau of British exit) was the withdrawal of the United Kingdom (UK) from the European Union (EU) and the European Atomic Energy Community (EAEC or Euratom) at the end of 31 January 2020 CET. The UK is the first and only country formally to leave the EU, after 47 years of having been a member state of the EU and its predecessor, the European Communities (EC), since 1 January 1973. It continued to participate in the European Union Customs Union and European Single Market during a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET).\\\\c\\\\cThe European Union and its institutions have developed gradually since their establishment, including 47 years of British membership, and grew to be of significant importance to the UK. Throughout that time Eurosceptic groups had existed, opposing aspects of the Union and its predecessors. Prime Minister Harold Wilsonâs pro-Europe government held a referendum on continued EC membership in 1975 in which voters chose to stay within the bloc with 67.2% of the vote share, but no further referendums were held as the project grew and became ever-closer in the subsequent Maastricht and Lisbon treaties. Facing pressure from Eurosceptic groups, Prime Minister David Cameron\\\\s pro-Europe government held a second referendum on continued EU membership in 2016 in which voters chose to leave the EU with 51.9% of the vote share. This led to his resignation, replacement by Theresa May, and four years of negotiations with the EU on the terms of departure and future relations. This process was both politically challenging and deeply divisive within the UK, with one deal rejected by the British parliament, general elections held in 2017 and 2019, and two new Prime Ministers in that time, both Conservative. Under Boris Johnson\\\\s government, the UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 CET; trade deal negotiations continued to within days of the scheduled end of the transition period on 31 December 2020 CET.\\\\c\\\\cThe effects of Brexit will in part be determined by the EUâUK Trade and Cooperation Agreement which was agreed on 24 December 2020 and ratified by the UK Parliament on 30 December 2020 and was provisionally applied by the EU from 31 December 2020. The broad consensus among economists is that Brexit will likely harm the UK\\\\s economy and reduce its real per capita income in the long term, and that the referendum itself damaged the economy. Brexit is likely to reduce immigration from European Economic Area (EEA) countries to the UK, and poses challenges for British higher education, academic research and security; the Turing scheme was announced as a new global student exchange programme in early 2021 to combat this. Following Brexit, EU law and the EU Court of Justice no longer have supremacy over British laws or its Supreme Court. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 retains relevant EU law as domestic law, which the UK could then amend or repeal.\\\\c\\\\cFollowing a UK-wide referendum in June 2016, in which 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU and 48.11% voted to remain a member, Prime Minister David Cameron resigned. On 29 March 2017, the new British Government led by Theresa May formally notified the EU of the country\\\\s intention to withdraw, beginning the Brexit process. The withdrawal was originally scheduled for 29 March 2019. It was delayed by deadlock in the British Parliament after the June 2017 general election, which resulted in a hung parliament in which the Conservatives lost their majority but remained the largest party. This deadlock led to three extensions of the Article 50 process.\\\\c\\\\cThe deadlock was resolved after a subsequent general election was held in December 2019. In that election, Conservatives who campaigned in support of a revised withdrawal agreement led by Boris Johnson won an overall majority of 80 seats. After the December 2019 election, the British Parliament finally ratified the withdrawal agreement. The UK left the EU at the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11 p.m. This began a transition period that ended on 31 December 2020 CET (11 p.m. GMT), during which the UK and EU negotiated their future relationship. During the transition, the UK remained subject to EU law and remained part of the EU customs union and single market. However, it was no longer part of the EU\\\\s political bodies or institutions.\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal was advocated by hard Eurosceptics and opposed by pro-Europeanists and soft Eurosceptics, with both sides of the argument spanning the political spectrum. The UK joined the European Communities (EC) â principally the European Economic Community (EEC) â in 1973, and its continued membership was endorsed in the 1975 referendum. In the 1970s and 1980s, withdrawal from the EC was advocated mainly by the political left, e.g. in the Labour Party\\\\s 1983 election manifesto. The 1992 Maastricht Treaty founded the EU, was ratified by the British Parliament in 1993 but was not put to a referendum. The Eurosceptic wing of the Conservative Party led a rebellion over ratification of the treaty and, with the UK Independence Party (UKIP) and the cross-party People\\\\s Pledge campaign then led a collective campaign particularly after the Treaty of Lisbon was also ratified by the European Union (Amendment) Act 2008 without being put to a referendum following a previous promise to hold a referendum on ratifying the abandoned European Constitution was never held eventually pressured the Conservative prime minister David Cameron to hold the June 2016 membership referendum. Cameron, who had campaigned to remain, resigned after the result and was succeeded by Theresa May.\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 March 2017, the British government formally began the withdrawal process by invoking Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union with permission from Parliament. May called a snap general election in June 2017, which resulted in a Conservative minority government supported by the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). UKâEU withdrawal negotiations began later that month. The UK negotiated to leave the EU customs union and single market. This resulted in the November 2018 withdrawal agreement, but the British parliament voted against ratifying it three times. The Labour Party wanted any agreement to maintain a customs union, while many Conservatives opposed the agreement\\\\s financial settlement, as well as the Irish backstop designed to prevent border controls between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The Liberal Democrats, Scottish National Party (SNP), and others sought to reverse Brexit through a proposed second referendum.\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 March 2019, the British Parliament voted for May to ask the EU to delay Brexit until June, and then later October. Having failed to get her agreement approved, May resigned as Prime Minister in July and was succeeded by Boris Johnson. He sought to replace parts of the agreement and vowed to leave the EU by the new deadline. On 17 October 2019, the British Government and the EU agreed on a revised withdrawal agreement, with new arrangements for Northern Ireland. Parliament approved the agreement for further scrutiny, but rejected passing it into law before the 31 October deadline, and forced the government (through the Benn Act) to ask for a third Brexit delay. An early general election was then held on 12 December. The Conservatives won a large majority in that election, with Johnson declaring that the UK would leave the EU in early 2020. The withdrawal agreement was ratified by the UK on 23 January and by the EU on 30 January; it came into force on 31 January 2020.\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the referendum of 23 June 2016, many new pieces of Brexit-related jargon entered popular use.\\\\c\\\\cThe Inner Six European countries signed the Treaty of Paris in 1951, establishing the European Coal and Steel Community (ECSC). The 1955 Messina Conference deemed that the ECSC was a success, and resolved to extend the concept further, thereby leading to the 1957 Treaties of Rome establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). In 1967, these became known as the European Communities (EC). The UK attempted to join in 1963 and 1967, but these applications were vetoed by the President of France, Charles de Gaulle.\\\\c\\\\cSome time after de Gaulle resigned in 1969, the UK successfully applied for EC membership, and the Conservative prime minister Edward Heath signed the Treaty of Accession in 1972. Parliament passed the European Communities Act later that year and the UK joined Denmark and Ireland in becoming a member on 1 January 1973.\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 1970s and 1980s, the Labour Party was the more Eurosceptic of the two major parties, and the Conservatives the more Europhile. The 1983 Labour Party manifesto would even pledge to leave the then European Economic Community. Earlier on, Labour had won the February 1974 general election without a majority and then contested the subsequent October 1974 general election with a commitment to renegotiate Britain\\\\s terms of membership of the EC, believing them to be unfavourable, and then hold a referendum on whether to remain in the EC on the new terms. Labour again won the election (this time with a small majority), and in 1975 the UK held its first ever national referendum, asking whether the UK should remain in the EC. Despite significant division within the ruling Labour Party, all major political parties and the mainstream press supported continuing membership of the EC. On 5 June 1975, 67.2% of the electorate and all but two British counties and regions voted to stay in; support for the UK to leave the EC in 1975 appears unrelated to the support for Leave in the 2016 referendum.\\\\c\\\\cThe Labour Party campaigned in the 1983 general election on a commitment to withdraw from the EC without a referendum. After their heavy defeat in that election, Labour changed its policy. In 1985, the second Margaret Thatcher government ratified the Single European Actâthe first major revision to the Treaty of Romeâwithout a referendum.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cIn October 1990, under pressure from senior ministers and despite Thatcher\\\\s deep reservations, the UK joined the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM), with the pound sterling pegged to the deutschmark. Thatcher resigned as Prime Minister the following month, amid Conservative Party divisions arising partly from her increasingly Eurosceptic views. The UK and Italy were forced to withdraw from the ERM in September 1992, after the pound sterling and the lira came under pressure from currency speculation (Black Wednesday).\\\\c\\\\cUnder the Maastricht Treaty, the EC became the EU on 1 November 1993, reflecting the evolution of the organisation from an economic union into a political one. Denmark, France, and Ireland held referendums to ratify the Maastricht Treaty. In accordance with Constitution of the United Kingdom, specifically that of parliamentary sovereignty, ratification in the UK was not subject to approval by referendum. Despite this, British constitutional historian Vernon Bogdanor wrote that there was a clear constitutional rationale for requiring a referendum because although MPs are entrusted with legislative power by the electorate, they are not given authority to transfer that power (the UK\\\\s previous three referendums all concerned this). Further, as the ratification of the treaty was in the manifestos of the three major political parties, voters opposed to ratification had no way to express it. For Bogdanor, while the ratification by the House of Commons might be legal, it would not be legitimateâwhich requires popular consent. The way in which the treaty was ratified, he judged, was likely to have fundamental consequences both for British politics and for Britain\\\\s relationship with the [EC]. This perceived democratic deficit directly led to the formation of the Referendum Party and the UK Independence Party.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cThatcher, who had previously supported the common market and the Single European Act, in the Bruges speech of 1988 warned against a European super-state exercising a new dominance from Brussels. She influenced Daniel Hannan, who in 1990 founded the Oxford Campaign for Independent Britain; With hindsight, some see this as the start of the campaign for Brexit, the Financial Times later wrote. In 1994, Sir James Goldsmith formed the Referendum Party to contest the 1997 general election on a platform of providing a referendum on the nature of the UK\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. The party fielded candidates in 547 constituencies at that election, and won 810,860 votesâ2.6% of the total votes castâbut failed to win a parliamentary seat because the vote was spread across the country. The Referendum Party disbanded after Goldsmith\\\\s death in 1997.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cThe UK Independence Party (UKIP), a Eurosceptic political party, was formed in 1993. It achieved third place in the UK during the 2004 European elections, second place in the 2009 European elections and first place in the 2014 European elections, with 27.5% of the total vote. This was the first time since the 1910 general election that any party other than Labour or the Conservatives had taken the largest share of the vote in a nationwide election. UKIP\\\\s electoral success in the 2014 European election is documented as the strongest correlate of the support for the Leave campaign in the 2016 referendum.\\\\c\\\\cUKIP won two by-elections (triggered by defecting Conservative MPs) in 2014; in the 2015 general election, the party took 12.6% of the total vote and held one of the two seats won in 2014.\\\\c\\\\cBoth pro- and anti-EU views had majority support at different times from 1977 to 2015. In the EC membership referendum of 1975, two-thirds of British voters favoured continued EC membership. Over the decades of UK-EU membership, Euroscepticism existed on both the left and right of British politics.\\\\c\\\\cAccording to a statistical analysis published in April 2016 by Professor John Curtice of Strathclyde University, surveys showed an increase in Euroscepticism (defined as a wish to sever or reduce the powers of the EU) from 38% in 1993 to 65% in 2015. The BSA survey for the period of JulyâNovember 2015 showed that 60% backed the option to continue as a member and 30% backed withdrawal.\\\\c\\\\cIn 2012, Prime Minister David Cameron initially rejected calls for a referendum on the UK\\\\s EU membership, but then suggested the possibility of a future referendum to endorse his proposed renegotiation of Britain\\\\s relationship with the rest of the EU. According to the BBC, The prime minister acknowledged the need to ensure the UK\\\\s [renegotiated] position within the [EU] had \\\\the full-hearted support of the British people\\\\ but they needed to show \\\\tactical and strategic patience\\\\. On 23 January 2013, under pressure from many of his MPs and from the rise of UKIP, Cameron promised in his Bloomberg speech that a Conservative government would hold an in-or-out referendum on EU membership before the end of 2017, on a renegotiated package, if elected in the 7 May 2015 general election. This was included in the Conservative Party manifesto for the election.\\\\c\\\\cThe Conservative Party won the election with a majority. Soon afterwards, the European Union Referendum Act 2015 was introduced into Parliament to enable the referendum. Cameron favoured remaining in a reformed EU, and sought to renegotiate on four key points: protection of the single market for non-eurozone countries, reduction of red tape, exempting Britain from ever-closer union, and restricting immigration from the rest of the EU.\\\\c\\\\cIn December 2015, opinion polls showed a clear majority in favour of remaining in the EU; they also showed support would drop if Cameron did not negotiate adequate safeguards[definition needed] for non-eurozone member states, and restrictions on benefits for non-UK EU citizens.\\\\c\\\\cThe outcome of the renegotiations was revealed in February 2016. Some limits to in-work benefits for new EU immigrants were agreed, but before they could be applied, a member state such as the UK would have to get permission from the European Commission and then from the European Council, which is composed of the heads of government of every member state.\\\\c\\\\cIn a speech to the House of Commons on 22 February 2016, Cameron announced a referendum date of 23 June 2016, and commented on the renegotiation settlement. He spoke of an intention to trigger the Article 50 process immediately following a Leave vote and of the two-year time period to negotiate the arrangements for exit.\\\\c\\\\cAfter the original wording for the referendum question was challenged, the government agreed to change the official referendum question to Should the United Kingdom remain a member of the European Union or leave the European Union?\\\\c\\\\cIn the referendum 51.89% voted in favour of leaving the EU (Leave), and 48.11% voted in favour of remaining a member of the EU (Remain). After this result, Cameron resigned on 13 July 2016, with Theresa May becoming Prime Minister after a leadership contest. A petition calling for a second referendum attracted more than four million signatures, but was rejected by the government on 9 July.\\\\c\\\\cA 2017 study published in Economic Policy showed that the Leave vote tended to be greater in areas which had lower incomes and high unemployment, a strong tradition of manufacturing employment, and in which the population had fewer qualifications. It also tended to be greater where there was a large flow of Eastern European migrants (mainly low-skilled workers) into areas with a large share of native low-skilled workers. Those in lower social grades (especially the working class) were more likely to vote Leave, while those in higher social grades (especially the upper middle class) more likely to vote Remain. Studies found that the Leave vote tended to be higher in areas affected by economic decline, high rates of suicides and drug-related deaths, and austerity reforms introduced in 2010.\\\\c\\\\cStudies suggest that older people were more likely to vote Leave, and younger people more likely to vote Remain. According to Thomas Sampson, an economist at the London School of Economics, Older and less-educated voters were more likely to vote \\\\leave\\\\ [...] A majority of white voters wanted to leave, but only 33% of Asian voters and 27% of black voters chose leave. There was no gender split in the vote [...] Leaving the European Union received support from across the political spectrum [...] Voting to leave the European Union was strongly associated with holding socially conservative political beliefs, opposing cosmopolitanism, and thinking life in Britain is getting worse.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polls found that Leave voters believed leaving the EU was more likely to bring about a better immigration system, improved border controls, a fairer welfare system, better quality of life, and the ability to control our own laws, while Remain voters believed EU membership would be better for the economy, international investment, and the UK\\\\s influence in the world. Polls found that the main reasons people voted Leave were the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK, and that leaving offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders. The main reason people voted Remain was that the risks of voting to leave the EU looked too great when it came to things like the economy, jobs and prices.\\\\c\\\\cWithdrawal from the European Union is governed by Article 50 of the Treaty on European Union. It was originally drafted by Lord Kerr of Kinlochard, and introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon at the insistence of the United Kingdom.[citation needed] The article states that any member state can withdraw in accordance with its own constitutional requirements by notifying the European Council of its intention to do so. The notification triggers a two-year negotiation period, in which the EU must negotiate and conclude an agreement with [the leaving] State, setting out the arrangements for its withdrawal, taking account of the framework for its future relationship with the [European] Union. If no agreement is reached within the two years, the membership ends without an agreement, unless an extension is unanimously agreed among all EU states, including the withdrawing state. On the EU side, the agreement needs to be ratified by qualified majority in the European Council, and by the European Parliament.\\\\c\\\\cThe 2015 Referendum Act did not expressly require Article 50 to be invoked, but prior to the referendum, the British government said it would respect the result. When Cameron resigned following the referendum, he said that it would be for the incoming prime minister to invoke Article 50. The new prime minister, Theresa May, said she would wait until 2017 to invoke the article, in order to prepare for the negotiations. In October 2016, she said Britain would trigger Article 50 in March 2017, and in December she gained the support of MP\\\\s for her timetable.\\\\c\\\\cIn January 2017, the Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled in the Miller case that government could only invoke Article 50 if authorised by an act of parliament to do so. The government subsequently introduced a bill for that purpose, and it was passed into law on 16 March as the European Union (Notification of Withdrawal) Act 2017. On 29 March, Theresa May triggered Article 50 when Tim Barrow, the British ambassador to the EU, delivered the invocation letter to European Council President Donald Tusk. This made 29 March 2019 the expected date that UK would leave EU.\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2017, Theresa May called a snap general election, held on 8 June, in an attempt to strengthen [her] hand in the negotiations; The Conservative Party, Labour and UKIP made manifesto pledges to implement the referendum, the Labour manifesto differing in its approach to Brexit negotiations, such as unilaterally offering permanent residence to EU immigrants. The Liberal Democrat Party and the Green Party manifestos proposed a policy of remaining in the EU via a second referendum. The Scottish National Party (SNP) manifesto proposed a policy of waiting for the outcome of the Brexit negotiations and then holding a referendum on Scottish independence.\\\\c\\\\cThe result produced an unexpected hung parliament, the governing Conservatives gained votes (but nevertheless lost seats and their majority in the House of Commons) but remained the largest party. Labour gained significantly on votes and seats, retaining its position as the second-largest party. The Liberal Democrats gained six seats despite a slight decrease in vote share compared with 2015. The Green Party kept its single MP while also losing national vote share. Losing votes and seats were the SNP, which lost 21 MPs, and UKIP, which suffered a -10.8% swing and lost its only MP. The Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Sinn FeÌin also made gains in votes and seats.\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 June 2017, Conservatives and the DUP reached a confidence and supply agreement whereby the DUP would back the Conservatives in key votes in the House of Commons over the course of the parliament. The agreement included additional funding of Â£1 billion for Northern Ireland, highlighted mutual support for Brexit and national security, expressed commitment to the Good Friday Agreement, and indicated that policies such as the state pension triple lock and Winter Fuel Payments would be maintained.\\\\c\\\\cPrior to the negotiations, May said that the British government would not seek permanent single market membership, would end ECJ jurisdiction, seek a new trade agreement, end free movement of people and maintain the Common Travel Area with Ireland. The EU had adopted its negotiating directives in May, and appointed Michel Barnier as Chief Negotiator. The EU wished to perform the negotiations in two phases:  first the UK would agree to a financial commitment and to lifelong benefits for EU citizens in Britain, and then negotiations on a future relationship could begin. In the first phase, the member states would demand that the UK pay a divorce bill, initially estimated as amounting to Â£52 billion. EU negotiators said that an agreement must be reached between UK and the EU by October 2018.\\\\c\\\\cNegotiations commenced on 19 June 2017. Negotiating groups were established for three topics: the rights of EU citizens living in Britain and vice versa; Britain\\\\s outstanding financial obligations to the EU; and the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. In December 2017, a partial agreement was reached. It ensured that there would be no hard border in Ireland, protected the rights of UK citizens in EU and EU citizens in Britain, and estimated the financial settlement to be Â£35â39 billion. May stressed that Nothing is agreed until everything is agreed. Following this partial agreement, EU leaders agreed to move on to the second phase in the negotiations:  discussion of the future relationship, a transition period and a possible trade deal.\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2018, a 21-month transition period and the terms for it were provisionally agreed. In June 2018, Irish Taoiseach Leo Varadkar said that there had been little progress on the Irish border questionâon which the EU proposed a backstop, to come into effect if no overall trade deal had been reached by the end of the transition periodâand that it was unlikely that there would be a solution before October, when the whole deal was to be agreed. In July 2018, the British government published the Chequers plan, its aims for the future relationship to be determined in the negotiations. The plan sought to keep British access to the single market for goods, but not necessarily for services, while allowing for an independent trade policy. The plan caused cabinet resignations, including Brexit Secretary David Davis and Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson.\\\\c\\\\cOn 13 November 2018, UK and EU negotiators agreed the text of a draft withdrawal agreement, and May secured her cabinet\\\\s backing of the deal the following day, though Brexit Secretary Dominic Raab resigned over fatal flaws in the agreement. It was expected that ratification in the British parliament would be difficult. On 25 November, all 27 leaders of the remaining EU countries endorsed the agreement.\\\\c\\\\cOn 10 December 2018, the Prime Minister postponed the vote in the House of Commons on her Brexit deal. This came minutes after the Prime Minister\\\\s Office confirmed the vote would be going ahead. Faced with the prospect of a defeat in the House of Commons, this option gave May more time to negotiate with Conservative backbenchers and the EU, even though they had ruled out further discussions. The decision was met with calls from many Welsh Labour MPs for a motion of no confidence in the Government.\\\\c\\\\cAlso on 10 December 2018, the European Court of Justice(ECJ) ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its notification of withdrawal, as long as it was still a member and had not agreed a withdrawal agreement. The decision to do so should be unequivocal and unconditional and follow a democratic process.If the British revoked their notification, they would remain a member of the EU under their current membership terms. The case was launched by Scottish politicians, and referred to the ECJ by the Scottish Court of Session.\\\\c\\\\cThe European Research Group (ERG), a staunchly anti-EU grouping in Conservative Party, opposed the Prime Minister\\\\s proposed Withdrawal Agreement treaty. Its members objected strongly to the Withdrawal Agreement\\\\s inclusion of the Irish backstop. ERG members also objected to the proposed Â£39 billion financial settlement with the EU and stated that the agreement would result in the UK\\\\s agreement to continuing to follow EU regulations in major policy areas; and to the continuing jurisdiction of the ECJ over interpretation of the agreement and of European law still applicable to the UK.\\\\c\\\\cOn 15 January 2019, the House of Commons voted 432 to 202 against the deal, which was the largest majority ever against a United Kingdom government. Soon after, a motion of no confidence in Her Majesty\\\\s Government was tabled by the opposition, which was rejected by 325 votes to 306.\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 February, Prime Minister May proposed that the next vote on the withdrawal agreement would be on 12 March 2019, 17 days away from the Brexit date. On 12 March, the proposal was defeated by 391 votes to 242âa loss by 149 votes, down from 230 from when the deal had been proposed in January.\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 March 2019, the Speaker informed the House of Commons that a third meaningful vote could be held only on a motion that was significantly different from the previous one, citing parliamentary precedents going back to 1604.\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement was brought back to the House without the attached understandings on 29 March. The Government\\\\s motion of support for the Withdrawal Agreement was defeated by 344 votes to 286âa loss by 58 votes, down from 149 when the deal had been proposed on 12 March.\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 March 2019, the Prime Minister wrote to European Council President Tusk requesting that Brexit be postponed until 30 June 2019. On 21 March 2019, May presented her case to a European Council summit meeting in Brussels. After May left the meeting, a discussion amongst the remaining EU leaders resulted in the rejection of 30 June date and offered instead a choice of two new alternative Brexit dates. On 22 March 2019, the extension options were agreed between the British government and the European Council. The first alternative offered was that if MPs rejected May\\\\s deal in the next week, Brexit would be due to occur by 12 April 2019, with, or without, a dealâor alternatively another extension be asked for and a commitment to participate in the 2019 European Parliament elections given. The second alternative offered was that if MPs approved May\\\\s deal, Brexit would be due to occur on 22 May 2019. The later date was the day before the start of European Parliament elections. After the government deemed unwarranted the concerns over the legality of the proposed change (because it contained two possible exit dates) the previous day, on 27 March 2019 both the Lords (without a vote) and the Commons (by 441 to 105) approved the statutory instrument changing the exit date to 22 May 2019 if a withdrawal deal is approved, or 12 April 2019 if it is not. The amendment was then signed into law at 12:40 p.m. the next day.\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the failure of the British Parliament to approve the Withdrawal Agreement by 29 March, the UK was required to leave the EU on 12 April 2019. On 10 April 2019, late-night talks in Brussels resulted in a further extension, to 31 October 2019; Theresa May had again requested an extension only until 30 June. Under the terms of this new extension, if the Withdrawal Agreement were to be passed before October, Brexit would occur on the first day of the subsequent month. The UK would then be obligated to hold European Parliament elections in May, or leave the EU on 1 June without a deal.\\\\c\\\\cIn granting the Article 50 extensions, the EU adopted a stance of refusing to reopen (that is, renegotiate) the Withdrawal Agreement.\\\\c\\\\cAfter Boris Johnson became prime minister on 24 July 2019 and met with EU leaders, the EU changed its stance. On 17 October 2019, following tunnel talks between UK and EU, a revised withdrawal agreement was agreed on negotiators level, and endorsed by the British government and the EU Commission. The revised deal contained a new Northern Ireland Protocol, as well as technical modifications to related articles. In addition, the Political Declaration was also revised. The revised deal and the political declaration was endorsed by the European Council later that day. To come into effect, it needed to be ratified by the European Parliament and the Parliament of the United Kingdom.\\\\c\\\\cThe British Parliament passed the European Union (Withdrawal) (No. 2) Act 2019, which received Royal Assent on 9 September 2019, obliging the Prime Minister to seek a third extension if no agreement has been reached at the next European Council meeting in October 2019. In order for such an extension to be granted if it is requested by the Prime Minister, it would be necessary for there to be unanimous agreement by all other heads of EU governments. On 28 October 2019, the third extension was agreed to by the EU, with a new withdrawal deadline of 31 January 2020. \\\\Exit day\\\\ in British law was then amended to this new date by statutory instrument on 30 October 2019.\\\\c\\\\cAfter Johnson was unable to induce Parliament to approve a revised version of the withdrawal agreement by the end of October, he chose to call for a snap election. The House of Commons supported the Early Parliamentary General Election Act 2019 by 438â20, setting the election date for Thursday 12 December. Opinion polls up to polling day showed a firm lead for the Conservatives against Labour throughout the campaign.\\\\c\\\\cIn the run-up to the general election on 12 December 2019 the Conservative Party pledged to leave the EU with the withdrawal agreement negotiated in October 2019. Labour promised to renegotiate aforementioned deal and hold a referendum, letting voters choose between the renegotiated deal and remain. The Liberal Democrats vowed to revoke Article 50, while the SNP intended to hold a second referendum, however, revoking Article 50 if the alternative was a no-deal exit. The DUP supported Brexit, but would seek to change parts related to Northern Ireland it was dissatisfied with. Plaid Cymru and the Green Party backed a second referendum, believing the UK should stay in the EU. The Brexit Party was the only major party running for election which wanted the UK to leave the EU without a deal.\\\\c\\\\cThe election produced a decisive result for Boris Johnson with the Conservatives winning 365 seats (gaining 47 seats) and a overall majority of 80 seats with Labour suffering their worst election defeat since 1935 after losing 60 seats to leave them with 202 seats and only a single seat in Scotland. The Liberal Democrats won just 11 seats with their leader Jo Swinson losing her own seat. The Scottish National Party won 48 seats after gaining 14 seats in Scotland.\\\\c\\\\cThe result broke the deadlock in the British Parliament and ended the possibility of a referendum being held on the withdrawal agreement and ensured that the United Kingdom would leave the European Union on 31 January 2020.\\\\c\\\\cSubsequently, the government introduced a bill to ratify the withdrawal agreement. It passed its second reading in the House of Commons in a 358â234 vote on 20 December 2019, and became law on 23 January 2020\\\\c\\\\cas the European Union (Withdrawal Agreement) Act 2020.\\\\c\\\\cThe withdrawal agreement received the backing of the constitutional committee in the European Parliament on 23 January 2020, setting expectation that the entire parliament would approve it in a later vote. On the following day, Ursula von der Leyen and Charles Michel signed the withdrawal agreement in Brussels, and it was sent to London where Boris Johnson signed it. The European Parliament gave its consent to ratification on 29 January by 621 votes to 49. Immediately after voting approval, members of the European Parliament joined hands and sang Auld Lang Syne. The Council of the European Union concluded EU ratification the following day.\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 January 2020 at 11 p.m. GMT, the United Kingdom\\\\s membership of the European Union ended 47 years after it joined.\\\\c\\\\cFollowing the British exit on 31 January 2020 the UK entered a Transition Period. Trade, travel and freedom of movement remain largely unchanged during this period. The transition period ended at 23:00 GMT (00:00 CET) on 31 December 2020.\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Agreement still applies after this date. This agreement provides free access of goods between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, provided checks are made to goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. The British Government attempted to back out of this commitment by passing the Internal Market Bill: domestic legislation in the British Parliament. In September, Northern Ireland secretary Brandon Lewis said:\\\\c\\\\cleading to the resignation of Sir Jonathan Jones, permanent secretary to the Government Legal Department and Lord Keen, the law officer for Scotland. The EU started legal action.\\\\c\\\\cDuring the transition period, David Frost and Michel Barnier continued to negotiate a permanent trade agreement. On 24 December 2020 both parties announced that a deal had been reached. The deal was passed by both houses of the British parliament on 30 December and given Royal Assent in the early hours of the next day. The transition period concluded under its terms the following evening. After the UK said it would unilaterally extend a grace period limiting checks on trade between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, the European Parliament postponed setting a date to ratify the agreement.\\\\c\\\\cIn October 2016, Theresa May promised a Great Repeal Bill, which would repeal the European Communities Act 1972 and restate in British law all enactments previously in force under EU law. Subsequently renamed the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, it was introduced to the House of Commons on 13 July 2017.\\\\c\\\\cOn 12 September 2017, the bill passed its first vote and second reading by a margin of 326 votes to 290 votes in the House of Commons. The bill was further amended on a series of votes in both Houses. After the Act became law on 26 June 2018, the European Council decided on 29 June to renew its call on Member States and European Union institutions to step up their work on preparedness at all levels and for all outcomes.\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act fixed the period ending 21 January 2019 for the government to decide on how to proceed if the negotiations had not reached agreement in principle on both the withdrawal arrangements and the framework for the future relationship between the UK and EU; while, alternatively, making future ratification of the withdrawal agreement as a treaty between the UK and EU depend upon the prior enactment of another act of Parliament for approving the final terms of withdrawal when the Brexit negotiations were completed. In any event, the act did not alter the two-year period for negotiating allowed by Article 50 that ended at the latest on 29 March 2019 if the UK had not by then ratified a withdrawal agreement or agreed a prolongation of the negotiating period.\\\\c\\\\cThe Withdrawal Act which became law in June 2018 allowed for various outcomes including no negotiated settlement. It authorises the government to bring into force, by order made under section 25, the provisions that fixed exit day and the repeal of the European Communities Act 1972, but exit day must be the same day and time as when the EU Treaties ceased to apply to the UK.\\\\c\\\\cExit day was the end of 31 January 2020 CET (11.00 p.m. The European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018 (as amended by a British Statutory Instrument on 11 April 2019), in section 20 (1), defined \\\\exit day\\\\ as 11:00 p.m. on 31 October 2019. Originally, \\\\exit day\\\\ was defined as 11:00 p.m. on 29 March 2019 GMT (UTC+0).\\\\c\\\\cA report published in March 2017 by the Institute for Government commented that, in addition to the European Union (Withdrawal) bill, primary and secondary legislation will be needed to cover the gaps in policy areas such as customs, immigration and agriculture. The report also commented that the role of the devolved legislatures was unclear, and could cause problems, and as many as 15 new additional Brexit Bills may be required, which would involve strict prioritisation and limiting Parliamentary time for in-depth examination of new legislation.\\\\c\\\\cIn 2016 and 2017, the House of Lords published a series of reports on Brexit-related subjects, including:\\\\c\\\\cThe Nuclear Safeguards Act 2018, relating to withdrawal from Euratom, was presented to Parliament in October 2017. The act makes provision about nuclear safeguards, and for connected\\\\c\\\\cpurposes. The Secretary of State may by regulations (nuclear safeguards regulations) make provision for the purpose of â (a) ensuring that qualifying nuclear material, facilities or\\\\c\\\\cequipment are available only for use for civil activities (whether in the UK or elsewhere), or (b) giving effect to provisions of a relevant international agreement.\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling overall showed an initial fall in support for Brexit from the referendum to late 2016, when responses were split evenly between support and opposition. Support rose again to a plurality, which held until the 2017 general election. Since then, opinion polls tended to show a plurality of support for remaining in the EU or for the view that Brexit was a mistake, with the estimated margin increasing until a small decrease in 2019 (to 53% Remain : 47% Leave, as of October 2019[update]). This seems to be largely due to a preference for remaining in the EU among those who did not vote in 2016\\\\s referendum (an estimated 2.5 million of whom, as of October 2019[update], were too young to vote at the time). Other reasons suggested include slightly more Leave voters than Remain voters (14% and 12% of each, respectively, as of October 2019[update]) changing how they would vote (particularly in Labour areas) and the deaths of older voters, most of whom voted to leave the EU.\\\\c\\\\cOne estimate of demographic changes (ignoring other effects) implies that had an EU referendum taken place in October 2019,[update] there would have been between 800,000 and 900,000 fewer Leave voters and between 600,000 and 700,000 more Remain voters, resulting in a Remain majority.\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2019, a petition submitted to the British Parliament petitions website, calling on the government to revoke Article 50 and stay in the EU, reached a record-level of more than 6.1 million signatures.\\\\c\\\\cPost-referendum opinion polling\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK was right or wrong to vote to leave the EU\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, including Neither responses\\\\c\\\\cOpinion polling on whether the UK should leave or remain in the EU, excluding Neither responses and normalised\\\\c\\\\cAfter the Brexit referendum, the Scottish Government â led by the Scottish National Party (SNP) â planned another independence referendum because Scotland voted to remain in the EU while England and Wales voted to leave. It had suggested this before the Brexit referendum. The First Minister of Scotland, Nicola Sturgeon, requested a referendum be held before the UK\\\\s withdrawal, but the British Prime Minister rejected this timing. The Scottish Parliament voted in favour of holding another independence referendum, with Sturgeon planning it for 2021. At the referendum in 2014, 55% of voters had decided to remain in the UK, but the referendum on Britain\\\\s withdrawal from the EU was held in 2016, with 62% of Scottish voters against it. In the event that Northern Ireland remains associated with the EU â for example, by remaining in the Customs Union â it is expected that Scotland will also insist on special treatment.\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 March 2018, the Scottish Parliament passed the Scottish Continuity Bill. This was passed by stalling negotiations between the Scottish Government and the British Government on where powers within devolved policy areas should lie after Brexit. The Act allows for all devolved policy areas to remain within the remit of the Scottish Parliament and reduces the executive power upon exit day that the UK Withdrawal Bill provides for Ministers of the Crown. The bill was referred to the Supreme Court, which found that it could not come into force as the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, which received royal assent between the Scottish Parliament passing its bill and the Supreme Court\\\\s judgement, designated itself under Schedule 4 of the Scotland Act 1998 as unamendable by the Scottish Parliament. The bill has therefore not received royal assent.\\\\c\\\\cOn 19 December 2018, the EU Commission revealed its no-deal Contingency Action Plan in specific sectors, in respect of the UK leaving the EU in 100 days\\\\ time.\\\\c\\\\cIn the wake of the United Kingdom\\\\s vote to leave the European Union, the Department for International Trade (DIT) for reaching and extending trade agreements between the UK and non-EU states was created by Prime Minister May, shortly after she took office on 13 July 2016. By 2017, it employed about 200 trade negotiators and was overseen by then Secretary of State for International Trade Liam Fox. In March 2019, the British government announced that it would cut many import tariffs to zero, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. The Confederation of British Industry said the move would be a sledgehammer for our economy, and the National Farmer\\\\s Union was also highly critical. Additionally, the plan appeared to breach standard WTO rules.\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 June 2020, Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel stated that the European Union must prepare for the possible failure of Brexit trade talks with the UK. She added that negotiations were being accelerated to try and reach a deal that could be ratified by the end of the year. Her warning came as the deadline for extending talks passed away, with negotiations expected to end on 31 December with or without a deal.\\\\c\\\\cThere has been litigation to explore the constitutional footings on which Brexit stands after R (Miller) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union (simply known as the Miller case) and the 2017 Notification Act:\\\\c\\\\cIn R. (Webster) v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union, a Divisional Court of Gross LJ and Green MR determined that the substantive decision to leave the EU that was notified on 29 March 2017 was in fact the executive decision of the Prime Minister using a statutory power of decision found to have been delegated to her by the Notification Act: this is confirmed by the House of Commons Library commentary on the case. The case was appealed to the Court of Appeal and paragraph 15 of the judgement, along with the citable nature of the decision were upheld.  While the case was criticised academically by Robert Craig, who lectures in jurisprudence at the London School of Economics, aspects of the case\\\\s analysis were supported by the Supreme Court in Miller 2 at paragraph 57, which confirmed that:\\\\c\\\\cThis confirmation that the decision was an executive act was part of the basis of R. (Wilson) v. Prime Minister which allied this point with the concerns about the irregularities in the referendum.  The High Court hearing was on 7 December 2018 before Ouseley MJ and when judgement was given it was held that: courtsâ job was not to rule on irregularities in the âleaveâ campaign as these were not questions of law; it was also said that the case was brought both too early and too late. Judgement in the Court of Appeal (before Hickinbottom LJ and Haddon-Cave LJ) before also went against the applicant.\\\\c\\\\cRegarding the reversibility of a notification under Article 50, Wightman and others v Secretary of State for Exiting the European Union was referred to Court of Justice of the European Union; the UK government sought to block this referral, taking the matter on appeal to the Supreme Court, but was unsuccessful. On 10 December 2018, the Court of Justice of the EU ruled that the UK could unilaterally revoke its Article 50 notification.\\\\c\\\\cMany effects of Brexit depended on whether the UK left with a withdrawal agreement, or before an agreement was ratified (no-deal Brexit). In 2017, the Financial Times said that there were approximately 759 international agreements, spanning 168 non-EU countries, that the UK would no longer be a party to upon leaving the EU.\\\\c\\\\cEconomists expect that Brexit will have damaging immediate and longer term effects on the economies of the UK and at least part of the EU27. In particular, there is a broad consensus among economists and in the economic literature that Brexit will likely reduce the UK\\\\s real per capita income in the medium and long term, and that the Brexit referendum itself damaged the economy. Studies found that Brexit-induced uncertainty reduced British GDP, British national income, investment by business, employment and British international trade from June 2016 onwards.\\\\c\\\\cA 2019 analysis found that British firms substantially increased offshoring to the EU after the Brexit referendum, whereas European firms reduced new investments in the UK. The British government\\\\s own Brexit analysis, leaked in January 2018, showed that British economic growth would be stunted by 2â8% over the 15 years following Brexit, the amount depending on the leave scenario. Economists warned that London\\\\s future as an international financial centre depended on passport agreements with the EU. Pro-Brexit activists and politicians have argued for negotiating trade and migration agreements with the CANZUK countriesâthose of Canada, Australia, New Zealand and the United Kingdomâbut economists have said that trade deals with those countries would be far less valuable to the UK than EU membership. Studies project that Brexit will exacerbate regional economic inequality in the UK, by hitting already-struggling regions the hardest.\\\\c\\\\cThe potential impact on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland has been a contentious issue. Since 2005, the border has been essentially invisible. After Brexit, it became the only UKâEU land border  (not counting the land border between the British Overseas Territory of Gibraltar with Spain). All involved parties agree a hard border should be avoided, as it might compromise the Good Friday Agreement that ended the Northern Ireland conflict. To forestall this, the EU proposed a backstop agreement (the Northern Ireland Protocol) that would have kept the UK in the Customs Union and kept Northern Ireland in some aspects of the Single Market also, until a lasting solution was found. The backstop was part of the withdrawal agreement, but was replaced in the revised agreement.\\\\c\\\\cBrexit caused the European Union to lose its second-largest economy, its third-most populous country, and the second-largest net contributor to the EU budget. Brexit will result in an additional financial burden for the remaining net contributors, unless the budget is reduced accordingly. The UK will no longer be a shareholder in the European Investment Bank, where it has 16% of the shares. Analyses indicate that the departure of the relatively economically liberal UK will reduce the ability of remaining economically liberal countries to block measures in the Council of the EU. In 2019, ahead of Brexit, the European Medicines Agency and European Banking Authority moved their headquarters from London to Amsterdam and Paris, respectively.\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will leave the Common Agricultural Policy (CAP), which provides government financial support to farmers in the EU. The UK receives much less than it contributes. Brexit allows the UK to develop its own agriculture policy. The current UK government has committed to maintaining the same payments to farmers until the end of the current parliament, even without a withdrawal agreement. The Agriculture Bill is intended to replace the CAP with a new system. The UK will also leave the Common Fisheries Policy (CFP) that lets all EU countries fish within 12 nautical miles of the British coast and lets the EU set catch quotas. The combined EU fishing fleets land about six million tonnes of fish per year, about half of which are from British waters. By leaving the CFP, the UK could develop its own fisheries policy. The UK will also leave the London Fisheries Convention that lets Irish, French, Belgian, Dutch and German vessels fish within six nautical miles of the UK\\\\s coast.\\\\c\\\\cGibraltar, a British Overseas Territory bordering Spain, will be affected by Brexit. Spain asserts a territorial claim on Gibraltar. After the referendum, Spain\\\\s Foreign Minister renewed calls for joint SpanishâBritish control. In late 2018, the British and Spanish governments agreed that any dispute over Gibraltar would not affect Brexit negotiations, and the British government agreed that UKâEU treaties made after Brexit would not automatically apply to Gibraltar.\\\\c\\\\cBrexit poses challenges to British academia and research, as the UK is likely to lose research funding from EU sources; see a reduction in students from the EU; find it harder to hire researchers from the EU; and British students will find it harder to study abroad in the EU. The UK is currently a member of the European Research Area and likely to wish to remain an associated member following Brexit. The British government has guaranteed funding for research currently funded by EU.\\\\c\\\\cAn early 2019 study found that Brexit would deplete the National Health Service (NHS) workforce, create uncertainties regarding care for British nationals living in the EU, and put at risk access to vaccines, equipment, and medicines. The Department of Health and Social Care has said it has taken steps to ensure the continuity of medical supplies after Brexit.  The number of non-British EU nurses registering with the NHS fell from 1,304 in July 2016 to 46 in April 2017.\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK will have the final say over the laws that govern it. Under the European Union (Withdrawal) Act 2018, EU laws will no longer have supremacy over British laws after Brexit. To maintain continuity, the Act converts EU law into British law as retained EU law. After Brexit, the British parliament (and the devolved legislatures) can decide which elements of that law to keep, amend or repeal. Furthermore, British courts will no longer be bound by the judgments of the EU Court of Justice after Brexit.\\\\c\\\\cAfter Brexit, the UK would be able to control immigration from the EU and EEA, as it can end EU freedom of movement. The current British government intends to replace it with a new system. The government\\\\s 2018 white paper proposes a skills-based immigration system that prioritizes skilled migrants. EU and EEA citizens already living in the UK can continue living there after Brexit by applying to the EU Settlement Scheme, which began in March 2019. Irish citizens will not have to apply to the scheme. Studies estimate that Brexit and the end of free movement will likely result in a large decline in immigration from EEA countries to the UK. After Brexit, any foreigner wanting to do so more than temporarily would need a work permit.\\\\c\\\\cBy leaving the EU, the UK would leave the European Common Aviation Area (ECAA), a single market in commercial air travel, but could negotiate a number of different future relationships with the EU. British airlines would still have permission to operate within the EU with no restrictions, and vice versa. The British government seeks continued participation in the European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA). The UK has its own air service agreements with 111 countries, which permit flights to-and-from the country, and further 17 countries through its EU membership. These have since been replaced. Ferries will continue, but with obstacles such as customs checks. New ferry departures between the Republic of Ireland and the European mainland have been established. As of August 2020[update], the government\\\\s Goods Vehicle Movement Service, an IT system essential to post-Brexit goods movements, was still only in the early stages of beta testing, with four months to go before it is required to be in operation.\\\\c\\\\cConcerns have been raised that Brexit might create security problems for the UK, particularly in law enforcement and counter-terrorism where the UK could use the EU\\\\s databases on individuals crossing the British border.\\\\c\\\\cBrexit has inspired many creative works, such as murals, sculptures, novels, plays, movies and video games. The response of British artists and writers to Brexit has in general been negative, reflecting a reported overwhelming percentage of people involved in Britain\\\\s creative industries voting against leaving the European Union. Despite issues around immigration being central in the Brexit debate, British artists left the migrants\\\\ perspective largely unexplored. However, Brexit also inspired UK-based migrant artists to create new works and claim agency over their representation within public spaces and create a platform for a new social imagination that can facilitate transnational and trans-local encounters, multicultural democratic spaces, sense of commonality, and solidarity\\\\c\\\\cAnti-Brexit protest in Manchester (2017) by sculptor Jacques Tilly\\\\c\\\\cDuÌsseldorf carnival parade in February 2018 by German by sculptor Jacques Tilly\\\\c\\\\cThe United Kingdom says that it has requested to respond to a European Union notification of intent to start legal proceedings over the UK\\\\s alleged breaching of the Northern Ireland Protocol by mid-May.

Bodycam footage of the shooting was released publicly on April 15.\\\\c\\\\cAdam Toledo was a seventh-grader at Gary Elementary School from the Little Village neighborhood in Chicago. He was 13 years old when the incident occurred.\\\\c\\\\cRuben Roman is a 21-year-old arrested by the Chicago PD at the scene.\\\\c\\\\cEric Stillman is the 34-year-old officer who killed Toledo. He was placed on administrative leave for 30 days following the incident.  Originally, police said Stillman had no complaints on his record. According to the organization that runs the police database however, he had three complaints and four use of force reports on his record at the time of the shooting.\\\\c\\\\cProsecutors alleged that at around 2:30 a.m., Toledo and Roman were walking toward 24th Street when Roman fired multiple rounds as a vehicle passed. Police ShotSpotter detector technology registered shots fired and a squad car arrived at the scene. According to prosecutors\\\\ initial claims, Toledo ran away from the officers, was chased into an alleyway, turned back to the officer with a gun in his hand, and was then shot in the chest. The police claimed a handgun was recovered at the scene from behind a fence after an armed confrontation.\\\\c\\\\cOn April 15, 2021, however, the released body cam footage of Toledoâs shooting showed he was unarmed at the moment of the shooting. The video shows the officer chasing Toledo into the alleyway, where Toledo slows down and stops. In footage taken from another angle, it appears that he tosses a weapon away, over a fence. The officer points a strobe flashlight at him and yells Show me your fucking hands. Toledo then turns around with his hands up. As he does so, the officer yells drop it, and Toledo is shot by the officer. Toledo was not holding a gun when he was shot, but it is uncertain if he was armed in the moments leading up to being shot.\\\\c\\\\cAfter shooting Toledo, officer Stillman calls for medical assistance and begins to perform CPR.\\\\c\\\\cChicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot has called for reforms to how police pursue individuals on foot and called for a thorough, expeditious investigation. Officials have said they are in the very early stages of interviewing witnesses and officers.\\\\c\\\\cIn the lead up to the release of the body cam footage, all Chicago police officers\\\\ days off were cancelled to ensure public safety. During the press conference releasing the body cam footage, Mayor Lightfoot also stated that the city would be putting into place plans to prepare for unrest.\\\\c\\\\cToledo is believed to be the youngest person killed by the Chicago Police Department in several decades.\\\\c\\\\cProtests have occurred in Chicago in the days following Toledo\\\\s death.\\\\c\\\\cColumnist Eric Zorn wrote an op-ed in the Chicago Tribune saying it was too early to say with confidence what happened and thus Toledo should not be portrayed as a martyr until more facts come out. His comments were received with outrage. Days later in another op-ed, Zorn wrote that the less supportive response ... took fair exception to my chilly, analytical tone ... I regret that tone. In focusing on details and marshaling evidence and arguments, I can neglect the emotional resonance in situations, as though I\\\\ve forgotten or don\\\\t care that a child who was loved has died, and that the death of someone with so much life ahead of him is always, always a tragedy. I should have done better.\\\\c\\\\cThe writer Roxanne Gay said, The Adam Toledo video was so horrifying that Chicago boarded up municipal buildings before the video was released. That tells you all you need to know.\\\\c\\\\cThe journalist Maria Hinojosa stated, Adam Toledo was a child. Not a threat.\\\\c\\\\cCongressman Joaquin Castro wrote on Twitter, Adam Toledo was 13-years-old. He complied and had his hands up. Chicago police killed him with a shot to the chest and then lied that he posed an imminent threat. The Toledo family deserves justice and accountability. His brother, former-Secretary Julian Castro, wrote, Chicago PD shot Adam Toledo with his hands in the air instantaneously after ordering him to do soâthen lied about it. They executed Adam, a boy who was not yet in high school. Indict this officer, then pass a national use of force standard immediately.\\\\c\\\\cSenate Majority Leader Chuck Schumer wrote, Adam Toledo was just 13 years old. He was a child.

The warning was prioritized to officers in Little Village, between Lawndale Avenue and Whipple Street.\\\\c\\\\cSeveral protests take place around the city after the video is released, including one that briefly shut down northbound Michigan Avenue and another at Union Park.',\n"," 'The GazaâIsrael conflict is a part of the localized IsraeliâPalestinian conflict, but is also a scene of power struggle between regional powers including Egypt, Iran and Turkey together with Qatar, supporting different sides of the conflict in light of the regional standoff between Iran and Saudi Arabia on one hand and between Qatar and Saudi Arabia on the other, as well as crisis in Egyptian-Turkish relations.\\\\c\\\\cThe conflict originated with the election of the Islamist political party Hamas in 2005 and 2006 in the Gaza Strip and escalated with the split of the Palestinian Authority Palestinian government into the Fatah government in the West Bank  and the Hamas government in Gaza and the following violent ousting of Fatah after Fatah lost the election to Hamas. Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel, Israeli airstrikes on Gaza, and the joint Egyptian-Israeli blockade of Gaza have exacerbated the conflict. The international community considers indiscriminate attacks on civilians and civilian structures that do not discriminate between civilians and military targets illegal under international law.\\\\c\\\\cAs part of its 2005 disengagement plan, Israel retained exclusive control over Gaza\\\\s airspace and territorial waters, continued to patrol and monitor the external land perimeter of the Gaza Strip, with the exception of its southernmost border (where Egypt retained control of the border and border crossings were supervised by European monitors) and continued to monitor and blockade Gaza\\\\s coastline. Israel largely provides and controls Gaza\\\\s water supply, electricity and communications infrastructure.  According to Human Rights Watch and Amnesty International, Israel remains an occupying power under international law. The United Nations has stated that under resolutions of both the General Assembly and the Security Council, it regards Gaza to be part of the Occupied Palestinian Territories. Meanwhile, the Fatah government in the West Bank, internationally recognized as the sole representative of the State of Palestine, refers to the Gaza Strip as part of the Palestinian state and does not recognize the Hamas government.\\\\c\\\\cThe IsraelâGaza barrier, completed in 1996, has helped reduce infiltration from Gaza Strip into Israel.[citation needed] Since the beginning of the Second Intifada, Gazans have not been permitted to enter Israel for work purposes. Special permits to enter Israel for medical purposes were also greatly reduced,[citation needed] which has made travel for Palestinians difficult.\\\\c\\\\cDaniel Schueftan, in his 1999 book, Disengagement: Israel and the Palestinian Entity (The Need for Separation: Israel and the Palestinian Authority) reviews new and existing arguments underlying different separation stances, in order to make the case for separation from the Palestinians, beginning with those in the West Bank and Gaza. Schueftan favors the hard separation stances of politicians like Yitzhak Rabin and Ehud Barak.\\\\c\\\\cYitzhak Rabin was the first to propose the creation of a physical barrier between the Israeli and Palestinian populations in 1992, and by 1994, construction on the first barrier â the IsraelâGaza barrier â had begun; it is actually a wire fence equipped with sensors. Following an attack on Bet Lid, near the city of Netanya, Rabin specified the objectives behind the undertaking, stating that:\\\\c\\\\cThe Second Intifada, also known as the al-Aqsa Intifada, began in September 2000. Many Palestinians consider the Intifada to be a struggle of national liberation against Israeli occupation imposed on them following the 1967 War, whereas many Israelis consider it to be a terrorist campaign.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cPalestinian tactics have ranged from carrying out mass protests and general strikes, as in the First Intifada, to mounting suicide bombing attacks and firing Qassam rockets into east southern Israeli residential areas. Israeli tactics range from conducting mass arrests and locking up Palestinians in administrative detention through setting up checkpoints and building the Israeli Gaza Strip barrier and West Bank barrier to carrying out assassinations targeting militants and leaders of Palestinian organizations.\\\\c\\\\cSince the 2006 Palestinian legislative election, Israel has been negotiating with Mahmoud Abbas and the PLO, but has been simultaneously targeting and bombing Hamas activists and militants and arresting Hamas\\\\s elected legislative counsel politicians.\\\\c\\\\cThe death toll, both military and civilian, over the entire period in question (2000â2007) is estimated to be over 4,300 Palestinians and over 1,000 Israelis. To date, 64 foreign citizens have also been killed (54 by Palestinians, and 10 by Israeli security forces).\\\\c\\\\cIsrael implemented its Disengagement Plan in AugustâSeptember 2005, withdrawing its civilian and military presence from the Gaza Strip, and retaining control over the Gaza airspace, maritime access and borders even with Egypt according to the 2005 agreement with Palestinian authority. Qassam rockets were fired regularly prior to the Israeli disengagement and the frequency of Qassam attacks increased after the Disengagement from Gaza. Palestinian militants have targeted a number of military bases and civilian towns in Southern Israel.\\\\c\\\\cSince 2001, Palestinian militants have launched thousands of rocket and mortar attacks on Israel from the Gaza Strip. Thirteen Israelis have been killed and hundreds injured as a result of Qassam rocket fire at Israeli targets. Additionally, Qassam rocket attacks have resulted in post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) in both children and adults, with 33% of children living in Sderot suffering from PTSD.\\\\c\\\\cWhen the Islamic party Hamas won the January 2006 Palestinian legislative election, gaining a majority of seats in the Palestinian Legislative Council, the conflict between Israel and Gaza intensified. Israel sealed its border with the Gaza Strip, largely preventing free flow of people and many imports and exports. Palestinians have been shooting Qassam rockets at Israeli settlements located near the Gaza borders, and have staged cross-border raids aimed at killing or capturing Israeli soldiers. In one such raid, on 25 June 2006, Palestinians captured Israeli soldier Gilad Shalit, leading to massive retaliation by the Israeli army which included air strikes against Hamas targets.\\\\c\\\\cIn June 2007, internal fighting broke out between Hamas and Fatah and Hamas fully consolidated its power by staging an armed coup d\\\\eÌtat and taking control of the Gaza Strip.  Following the internecine fighting that occurred between 7 and 15 June 2007, also known as the Battle of Gaza 2007 in which 118 Palestinians were killed and over 550 were wounded, the entire Gaza Strip came under full control of a Hamas government.\\\\c\\\\cAs a response to the Hamas takeover, Israel sharply restricted the flow of people and goods into and out of Gaza. About 70% of Gaza\\\\s workforce have become unemployed or without pay, and about 80% of its residents live in poverty.\\\\c\\\\cSince Hamas\\\\ takeover, Palestinian armed groups in Gaza and Israel continued to clash. Palestinian armed groups have fired rockets into Israel, killing Israeli civilians, including children, and wounding others, as well as causing damage to infrastructure; and Israel have launched attacks, and shelled Gaza with artillery, killing Palestinian combatants as well as civilians, including children, and causing devastating damage to infrastructure. According to Human Rights Watch, the Palestinian deliberate attacks against civilians violate international humanitarian law. Because Hamas exercises power inside Gaza, it is responsible for stopping unlawful attacks even when carried out by other groups.\\\\c\\\\cLarge-scale conventional warfare beyond the peripheries of the Gaza Strip began when Palestinian militants abducted Corporal Gilad Shalit, and Israel responded by launching Operation Summer Rains on 28 June 2006. The operation became the first major mobilization within the Gaza Strip since Israel unilaterally disengaged from the region between August and September 2005.\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza beach blast was an event on 9 June 2006 in which eight Palestinians were killed â including nearly the entire family of seven-year-old Huda Ghaliya â and at least thirty others were injured in an explosion on a beach near the municipality of Beit Lahia in the Gaza Strip. The incident received considerable attention from news media worldwide, with blame for the explosion hotly disputed in the following weeks.\\\\c\\\\cIsrael maintains that it mobilized thousands of troops in order to suppress Qassam rocket fire against its civilian population and to secure the release of Gilad Shalit. It is estimated that between 7,000 and 9,000 Israeli artillery shells were fired into Gaza between September 2005 and June 2006, killing 80 Palestinians in 6 months. On the Palestinian side, over 1,300 Qassam rockets have been fired into Israel from September 2000 to 21 December 2006.[citation needed] Israeli forces also continued to search for tunnels, used by militants to smuggle weapons, as well as monitor operations at checkpoints (with some assistance from the European Union at Rafah) for security reasons, specifically possible weapons transfers and uninhibited return of exiled extremist leaders and terrorists. As of 18 October 2006, Israel has discovered 20 tunnels used for illegal arms smuggling under the border of the Gaza Strip and Egypt.\\\\c\\\\cIsrael had said it would withdraw from the Strip and end the operation as soon as Shalit was released. The Palestinians had said that they were willing to return Shalit in exchange for the release of some of the Palestinians held in Israeli jails. The Palestinians and others have also said the assault was aimed at toppling the democratically elected Hamas-led government and at destabilizing the Palestinian National Authority, citing the targeting of civilian infrastructure such as a power station and the captures of government and parliament members. Some 300 Palestinians had been targeted by the IDF in the Gaza Strip since the kidnapping of Corporal Gilad Shalit.\\\\c\\\\cIn July 2006, first reports emerged about mystery injuries after Israeli attacks. Previously unseen injuries included severely damaged internal organs, severe internal burning and deep internal wounds often resulting in amputations or death. Bodies arrived severely fragmented, melted and disfigured. There were speculations about a new experimental weapon, particularly Dense Inert Metal Explosives (DIMEs).\\\\c\\\\cAttempting to curb Qassam rocket attacks fired at Southern Israel by Palestinian militants from the northern Gaza Strip,\\\\c\\\\cIsrael launched Operation Autumn Clouds on 1 November 2006.\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 November 2006, a day after Israel\\\\s withdrawal following Operation Autumn Clouds, Israel Defense Forces shells missed their targetâpossibly due to a technical malfunctionâand hit a row of houses in the Gaza Strip town of Beit Hanoun, killing 19 Palestinians and wounding more than 40. Israeli Defense Forces launched an investigation into the Beit Hanoun November 2006 incident (and later apologized for the incident), and the then Israeli President Ehud Olmert offered humanitarian assistance to those affected.\\\\c\\\\cThe 2006 FrancoâItalianâSpanish Middle East Peace Plan was proposed after Israel invaded the Gaza Strip in Operation Autumn Clouds by Spanish Premier JoseÌ Luis RodriÌguez Zapatero during talks with French president Jacques Chirac. Italy\\\\s prime minister Romano Prodi gave his full support to the plan.\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 November, a ceasefire was signed by Palestinian organisations and Israel, and Israel withdrew its troops while the Palestinian Authority forces deployed to stop Qassam rocket launchings. Following the truce over 60 Qassam rockets were fired from the Gaza Strip at Israel, and 1 Palestinian (armed with guns and grenades) was killed by the IDF. On 19 December, the Palestinian Islamic Jihad began taking open responsibility for the Qassam rocket firing, because they said Israel killed two of their members in Jenin.\\\\c\\\\cA series of battles between Palestinian militants in Hamas-governed Gaza and the Israel Defense Forces (IDF) that began in mid-May 2007, with the inter-Palestinian violence flaring in the meantime. Palestinians fired more than 220 Qassam rocket attacks on Israel (Sderot and the western Negev) in more than a week. The Israeli Air Force fired missiles and bombs at the launching sites. The fighting came amid serious Palestinian factional violence and reports of growing level of humanitarian crisis in the region. Hamas said they will continue to retaliate against Israeli strikes.\\\\c\\\\cIn September 2007, citing an intensification of Qassam rocket attacks, Israel declared Gaza hostile territory. The declaration allowed Israel to prevent the transfer of electricity, fuel, and other supplies into Gaza. The stated purpose of this blockade was to pressure Hamas into ending the rocket attacks and to deprive them of the supplies necessary for the continuation of rocket attacks. Israel\\\\s decision to cut fuel supplies to Gaza were widely condemned as collective punishment.\\\\c\\\\cIsrael has also arrested Hamas officials in the West Bank, including two cabinet members. Such arrests have been strongly condemned by international organizations and politicians.\\\\c\\\\cBy January 2008, according to a United Nations study, the economic effects of Israel\\\\s blockade on Gaza reached a critical threshold. Finally, on 17 January 2008, Israel sealed the border completely following a rise in rocket attacks. The breach of the Gaza-Egypt border began on 23 January 2008, after gunmen in the Gaza Strip set off an explosion near the Rafah Border Crossing, destroying part of the former Israeli Gaza Strip barrier. The United Nations estimates that as many as half the 1.5 million population of the Gaza Strip crossed the border into Egypt seeking food and supplies.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 February 2008, Palestinian militants fired more than 40 Qassam rockets into southern Israel and the Israeli army fired three missiles at the Palestinian Interior Ministry in Gaza destroying the building. On 28 February 2008 Israeli aircraft bombed a police station near the Gaza City home of Hamas leader Ismail Haniya, killing several children. The Israeli military says its air and ground operations against militants firing rockets from northern Gaza have hit at least 23 armed Palestinians, while Palestinian sources have reported higher death tolls and say many civilians have also been killed.\\\\c\\\\cIsrael began its air and ground operations on 29 February. The IDF\\\\s offensive in Gaza has killed more than 100 Palestinians in less than a week. Palestinians fired 150 rockets at Israel which killed three Israelis. The United States called for an end to clashes between Israel and the Palestinians. The Palestinian president, Mahmoud Abbas, has accused Israel of international terrorism, saying its assault on Gaza constitutes more than a holocaust. On 3 March Abbas suspended all contact with Israel over its assault on Gaza as the Israeli government sent warplanes to hit more targets early on Monday and vowed to continue its offensive. The European Union condemned what it called disproportionate use of force by the Israeli military in Gaza after 54 Palestinians were killed in the highest casualty toll for a single day since fighting erupted in 2000. United Nations Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon also issued a condemnation of what he termed Israel\\\\s excessive and disproportionate response, and called on Israel to cease such attacks, while denouncing the ongoing rocket attacks on Sderot and Ashkelon. In the Muslim world, demonstrators took to the streets to protest the IDF attacks. Iran\\\\s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei called on Muslims to rise up and their leaders to hit Israel in the face with their nations\\\\ anger. In Lebanon, hundreds of Hezbollah supporters gathered at the Fatima Gate at the border between Lebanon and Israel, shouting Death to Israel and waving Lebanese and Palestinian flags. In Egypt, thousands of students held protests at universities across the country calling on Arab leaders to stop Israeli aggression and support the Palestinians. Some protesters burned Israeli and American flags. About 10,000 protesters, mainly from Jordan\\\\s mainstream Muslim Brotherhood and smaller opposition groups, took to the streets in one of the country\\\\s most vocal and largest anti-Israeli demonstrations in recent years. Saudi Arabia meanwhile compared the IDF offensive to Nazi war crimes and called on the international community to stop what it called the mass killings of Palestinians. Turkey\\\\s Prime Minister Recep Tayyip Erdogan said that the IDF attacks can have no humanitarian justification and added that Israel was rejecting a diplomatic solution to the dispute. Most Israeli tanks and troops pulled out of northern Gaza 3 March 2008, and an Israel Defense Forces spokesman confirmed that the Israeli military was ending offensive operations there after five days.\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 February 2008, the Israeli military launched Operation Hot Winter (also called Operation Warm Winter) in response to Qassam rockets fired from the Strip by Hamas. The Israeli army killed 112 Palestinians, and Palestinian militants killed three Israelis. More than 150 Palestinians and seven Israelis have been injured.\\\\c\\\\cThere was widespread international alarm at the scale of the operation, with the US state department encouraging Israel to exercise caution to avoid the loss of innocent life, and the European Union and the United Nations criticising Israel\\\\s disproportionate use of force. The European Union also demanded an immediate end to Palestinian militant rocket attacks on Israel and urged Israel to halt activities that endanger civilians, saying they were in violation of international law.\\\\c\\\\cThe 2008 IsraelâHamas ceasefire was an Egyptian-brokered six-month Tahdia (an Arabic term for a lull) for the Gaza area, which went into effect between Hamas and Israel on 19 June 2008. Hamas\\\\ obligation was to stop the rocket attacks on Israel. During the initial 5-months of the ceasefire, and after a shaky start during the initial week, these attacks from Gaza decreased significantly for a total of 19 rocket and 18 mortar shell launchings, compared to 1199 rockets and 1072 mortar shells in 2008 up to 19 June, a reduction of 98%.  Mark Regev, spokesman for the Israeli Prime Minister acknowledged that there were no Hamas rockets during the ceasefire before November the 4th. Israel\\\\s obligation was to cease attacks on Gaza and once the ceasefire held, to gradually begin to ease its punishing blockade of Gaza. The agreement called on Israel to increase the level of goods entering Gaza by 30 percent over the pre-lull period within 72 hours and to open all border crossings and allow the transfer of all goods that were banned and restricted to go into Gaza within 13 days after the beginning of the ceasefire.[better source needed] The increase in supplies of food, water, medicine and fuel did improve, but the increase was only to an average of about 20 percent of normal levels, compared to the Hamas compliance in reducing rocket fire by 98%. Two months later the volume of goods arriving was too low to significantly improved living conditions, preventing UNRWA from replenishing its stores. Israel told U.S. officials in 2008 it would keep Gaza\\\\s economy on the brink of collapse.\\\\c\\\\cOn 4 November 2008 Israel broke the ceasefire with an attack on Gaza. The Israeli military claimed the target of the raid was a tunnel that they said Hamas was planning to use to capture Israeli soldiers positioned on the border fence 250m away. Hamas officials differed, however, claiming that the tunnel was being dug for defensive purposes, not to capture IDF personnel, according to Dr Robert Pastor (of the Carter Institute), and an IDF official confirmed that fact to him. Hamas replied to the Israeli attack with a barrage of rocket fire. With this incursion into Gaza territory and its non-compliance with the easing of the embargo, Israel had failed to comply with two aspects of the June 2008 ceasefire.\\\\c\\\\cWhen the six-month truce officially expired on 19 December, Hamas launched 50 to more than 70 rockets and mortars into Israel over the next three days, though no Israelis were injured. On 21 December, Hamas said it was ready to stop the attacks and renew the truce if Israel stopped its aggression in Gaza and opened up its border crossings. On 27 and 28 December, Israel implemented Operation Cast Lead against Hamas. Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak said We warned Hamas repeatedly that rejecting the truce would push Israel to aggression against Gaza.\\\\c\\\\cThe Gaza War started when Israel launched a large military campaign in the Gaza Strip on 27 December 2008, codenamed Operation Cast Lead (Hebrew: ×××¦×¢ ×¢××¤×¨×ª ××¦××§×), with the stated aim of stopping Hamas rocket attacks on southern Israel and arms smuggling into Gaza. The conflict has also been called the Gaza massacre in the Arab world (Arabic: ÙØ¬Ø²Ø±Ø© ØºØ²Ø©). A fragile six-month truce between Hamas and Israel expired on 19 December 2008. The Israeli operation began with an intense bombardment of the Gaza Strip, targeting Hamas bases, police training camps, police headquarters and offices. Civilian infrastructure, including mosques, houses, medical facilities and schools, were also attacked, as Israel stated that many of them were used by combatants, and as storage spaces for weapons and rockets. Hamas intensified its rocket and mortar attacks against targets in Israel throughout the conflict, hitting previously untargeted cities such as Beersheba and Ashdod. On 3 January 2009, the Israeli ground invasion began. Human rights groups and aid organisations have accused Hamas and Israel of war crimes. An estimated 1,166-1,417 Palestinians and 13 Israelis died in the conflict. The conflict came to an end on 18 January after first Israel and then Hamas announced unilateral ceasefires. On 21 January, Israel completed its withdrawal from the Gaza Strip. On 2 March, it was reported that international donors had pledged $4.5 billion in aid for the Palestinians, mainly for rebuilding Gaza after Israel\\\\s offensive. This war is considered to be the largest, devastating and deadliest military operation in Gaza since the Six-day war in 1967.\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 March 2010, two Israeli soldiers and two Hamas militants were killed during clashes on the Gaza Strip\\\\s southern border. Two other soldiers were wounded during the fighting which broke out east of the town of Khan Younis. They are the first Israeli soldiers to have been killed in hostile fire in or around Gaza since Israel\\\\s major offensive there in January 2009, according to the BBC.\\\\c\\\\cOn 18 August 2011, a series of cross-border attacks was carried out in southern Israel near the Egyptian border, by a squad of militants. The militants first opened fire at civilian bus. Several minutes later, a bomb was detonated next to an Israeli army patrol along Israel\\\\s border with Egypt. In a third attack, an anti-tank missile hit a private vehicle, killing four civilians.\\\\c\\\\cDuring the second week of March 2012, Israeli Defense Forces (IDF) initiated Operation Returning Echo. It was the worst outbreak of violence covered by the media in the region since the 2008â09 Operation Cast Lead (the Gaza War).\\\\c\\\\cAttacks by Israel and Gazans grew intense late in October 2012. An Israeli air strike killed Ahmed Jabari, chief of the Hamas military wing in Gaza. During the operation, four Israeli civilians and one soldier were killed by Palestinian rocket fire, according to Palestinian Centre for Human Rights 158 Palestinians had been killed, of which: 102 were civilians, 55 militants and one was policeman. 30 children and 13 women were among the killed, while the Israel Defense Forces presented statistics showing that out of 177 Palestinians killed, 120 were militants.  Most of the fighting was by bombs, aerial attacks, artillery, and rockets; the rockets being primarily used by the Palestinians and air strikes primarily by the Israelis. Attacked locations include Beersheva, Tel Aviv, Ashdod, Ofakim, Gaza, the rest of the Gaza Strip, the Shaar Hanegev, and Eshkol Regional Council. The United States, United Kingdom, Canada, Germany and other Western countries expressed support for Israel\\\\s right to defend itself, and/or[clarification needed] condemned the Palestinian rocket attacks on Israel. Iran, Egypt, Turkey, North Korea and several other Arab and Muslim countries condemned the Israeli operation.\\\\c\\\\cIn 2014, fighting intensified between Israel and Hamas, leading to another full-scale Gaza War, this one far deadlier than the previous in 2008â2009. The IDF launched Operation Protective Edge on 8 July 2014, in response to Hamas rocket attacks, which were launched following an earlier Israeli air strike against Gaza and on 17 July 2014, Israel troops entered the Gaza Strip. UN OCHA says 2,205 Palestinians (including at least 1,483 civilians) and 71 Israelis (including 66 soldiers) and one foreign national in Israel were killed in the conflict. The war came to an end after 50 days of conflict when a ceasefire was agreed upon on 26 August 2014.\\\\c\\\\cDuring the 2018 Land Day protests, 168 Palestinians have been killed and thousands were injured during clashes with Israeli troops at the Gaza-Israel border.\\\\c\\\\cViolence flared up again on 11 November 2018 when seven Palestinian militants were killed during a botched raid by the Israel Defense Forces in the southeastern Gaza Strip. One IDF officer was killed and another was injured. Over a dozen rockets were subsequently fired from Gaza, three of which were shot down. After a series of intense fire exchanges, ceasefire was agreed upon on 13 November 2018.\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 March, seven people were injured in Israel after a rocket attack destroyed a home in Mishmeret. The Israel Defense Forces confirmed that Hamas was responsible for the attack.\\\\c\\\\cThe Israeli Air Force sent jets to strike multiple targets in the Gaza Strip, including the office of senior Hamas official Ismail Haniyeh, and Hamas\\\\ military intelligence headquarters in Gaza City.\\\\c\\\\cOn 3 May, two Israeli soldiers were injured by a Palestinian Islamic Jihad sniper from in the Gaza Strip during the weekly protests at the GazaâIsrael border. In response, the Israeli Air Force carried out an airstrike, killing four Palestinians. In addition, two other Palestinians were killed and 60 wounded, 36 of them by Israeli gunfire.\\\\c\\\\cFollowing this, Gazan militants launched hundreds of rockets at Israel. In response, the Israeli Air Force struck numerous targets within the Gaza Strip. In addition, Israel increased its troop presence near the GazaâIsrael border.\\\\c\\\\cOn 31 July 2014 on the 23rd day of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict, Ireland\\\\s Foreign Minister Charlie Flanagan said he shared the horror and revulsion of senators and very many of our citizens at the horrendous scenes we have witnessed since the start of the Israeli military operation. The Irish government, he said, condemned both the unacceptably high civilian casualty rate resulting from disproportionate military action on Israel\\\\s part as well as the firing of rockets by Hamas and other militants into Israel. On 5 August 2014 a member of the British cabinet resigned over the UK government\\\\s approach to the 2014 conflict.\\\\c\\\\cPresidential campaigns of 2016, Democratic candidate Bernie Sanders criticized Israel for its treatment of Gaza, and in particular criticized Netanyahu for overreacting and causing unnecessary civilian deaths. In April 2016 the Anti-Defamation League called on Sanders to withdraw remarks he made to the New York Daily News, which the ADL said exaggerated the death toll of the 2014 IsraelâGaza conflict. Sanders said over 10,000 innocent people were killed, a number far in excess of Palestinian or Israel sources\\\\ estimates. In response, Sanders said that he accepted a corrected number of the death toll as 2,300 in the course of the interview and that he would make every effort to set the record straight. The transcript of the interview failed to note that Sanders said Okay to the corrected number presented by the interviewer during the course of the interview.\\\\c\\\\cAccording to NGOs and the UN, the recent wars and the blockade have led to worsting living conditions in Gaza and could be become unlivable by 2020.\\\\c\\\\cDue to the conflict, Israel has stepped up its defense measures in the southern communities and cities of Israel. This includes building fortifications on existing structures and bomb shelters, developing an alarm system (Red Color) and building an air-defense system (Iron Dome) \\\\c\\\\cIsraeli Air Force jets and helicopters strike Hamas-linked targets in the Gaza Strip in retaliation for earlier rocket fire targeting southern Israel. The IDF says that an armaments production facility and a tunnel used to smuggle weapons were hit.',\n"," 'On April 15, 2021, a mass shooting occurred at a FedEx Ground facility in Indianapolis, Indiana, United States. Nine people were killed, including the gunman, 19-year-old former employee Brandon Scott Hole, who committed suicide. Four others were injured. Hole\\\\s motive remains unknown.\\\\c\\\\cThe FedEx facility where the shooting occurred is located in the southwestern part of the city, near Indianapolis International Airport. It is the company\\\\s second-busiest hub, with nearly 4,000 employees in total. The building is equipped with metal detectors and security turnstiles at its entrance requiring the employees to scan their FedEx badges. There were at least 100 people in the facility at the time of the shooting, and many of them were changing shifts or on dinner breaks.\\\\c\\\\cAccording to Indianapolis Deputy Police Chief Craig McCartt, the gunman entered the facility in a vehicle and, after exiting unprovoked, immediately began firing. Afterwards, the gunman entered the facility and began shooting again. The shooting lasted several minutes. Officers with the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department responded to the scene shortly after 11:00 p.m. However, the shooter took his own life by that point.\\\\c\\\\cThe shooting resulted in a brief closure of Interstate 70 at Ameriplex Parkway, which reopened shortly afterwards.\\\\c\\\\cThere were nine fatalities in the shooting, including the gunman. Excluding the gunman, four victims were found dead outside of the facility, with the other four being found dead inside. Five people were taken to the hospital, including one in critical condition; four of them suffered gunshot wounds.\\\\c\\\\cPolice identified the gunman as Brandon Scott Hole, a 19-year-old resident of Indiana who had been employed at the Indianapolis facility until 2020. After the shooting, authorities conducted a search of his home and seized evidence, including electronics.\\\\c\\\\cIn March 2020, Hole\\\\s mother contacted the FBI and local authorities and warned them about her son\\\\s intent to commit suicide by cop, prompting a preliminary investigation to be opened. Hole was placed in a temporary mental health hold by the Indianapolis Metropolitan Police Department. They seized a shotgun from him, and the FBI questioned Hole about unspecified items found in his bedroom in April 2020. Eventually, the investigation was closed due to insufficient evidence of any criminal violation, and the shotgun was not returned to Hole. Previously, in 2013, local police contacted Hole for unclear reasons.\\\\c\\\\cOn April 16, President Joe Biden ordered flags to be flown at half-staff.

Originally scheduled to take place from 24 July to 9 August 2020, the event was postponed to 2021 in March 2020 as a result of the COVID-19 pandemic, the first such instance in the history of the Olympic Games (previous games had been cancelled but not rescheduled). However, the event retains the Tokyo 2020 name for marketing and branding purposes. It is being held largely behind closed doors with no public spectators permitted due to the declaration of a state of emergency. The Summer Paralympics will be held between 24 August and 5 September 2021, 16 days after the completion of the Olympics\\\\c\\\\cThe 2020 Games are the fourth Olympic Games to be held in Japan, following the Tokyo 1964 (Summer), Sapporo 1972 (Winter), and Nagano 1998 (Winter) games. Tokyo is the first city in Asia to hold the Summer Games twice. The 2020 Games are the second of three consecutive Olympics to be held in East Asia, following the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, South Korea, and preceding the 2022 Winter Olympics in Beijing, China\\\\c\\\\cThe 2020 Games introduced new competitions and re-introduced competitions that once were held but were subsequently removed. New ones include 3x3 basketball, freestyle BMX and mixed gender team events in a number of existing sports, as well as the return of madison cycling for men and an introduction of the same event for women. New IOC policies also allow the host organizing committee to add new sports to the Olympic program for just one Games. The disciplines added by the Japanese Olympic Committee are baseball and softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding, the last four of which make their Olympic debuts\\\\c\\\\cBermuda, the Philippines, and Qatar won their first-ever Olympic gold medals. San Marino, Turkmenistan, and Burkina Faso won their first-ever Olympic medals\\\\c\\\\cThe three candidate cities were Tokyo, Istanbul, and Madrid. The applicant cities of Baku and Doha were not promoted to candidate status. A bid from Rome was withdrawn.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cThe International Olympic Committee (IOC) voted to select the host city of the 2020 Summer Olympics on 7 September 2013, at the 125th IOC Session in Buenos Aires, Argentina, using an exhaustive ballot system.[citation needed] None of the candidate cities won more than 50% of the votes in the first round; Madrid and Istanbul were tied for second place, so a runoff vote was held to determine which of the two cities would be eliminated. The final vote was a head-to-head contest between Tokyo and Istanbul. Tokyo was selected by 60 votes to 36, gaining at least the 49 votes required for a majority.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cIn January 2020, concerns were raised about the potential impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on athletes and visitors to the Olympic Games. Tokyo organizers insisted they were monitoring the spread of the disease to minimize its effects on preparations for the Olympics. The IOC stated that in 2020, their Japanese partners and Prime Minister Shinzo Abe made it very clear that Japan could not manage a postponement beyond next summer [2021] at the latest. Unlike the case for Zika virus during the 2016 Summer Olympics in Rio de Janeiro, SARS-CoV-2 can be transmitted directly between humans, posing tougher challenges for the organizers to counteract the infectious disease and host a safe and secure event. Also unlike the case for H1N1 swine flu during the 2010 Winter Olympics in Vancouver, COVID-19 has a higher fatality rate, and there was no effective vaccine until December 2020. In a February 2020 interview, Conservative London mayoral candidate Shaun Bailey argued that London would be able to host the Olympic Games at the former 2012 Olympic venues should the Games need to be moved because of the COVID-19 pandemic. Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike criticized Bailey\\\\s comment as inappropriate. In early 2021, officials in the U.S. state of Florida offered to host the delayed Games in their state, while John Coates, the IOC vice president in charge of the Tokyo Olympics, said the Games would open even if the city and other parts of Japan were under a state of emergency because of COVID-19\\\\c\\\\cEstimates by the National Institute of Infectious Diseases and Kyoto University predicted that states of emergency may be required during the Games. The reports published at the Ministry of Health experts\\\\ panel also showed new patients increasing to 10,000 if the Games were to allow spectators\\\\c\\\\cConcerns about the pandemic began to affect qualifying events in early 2020. Some that were due to take place in February were moved to alternative locations to address concerns about travelling to the affected areas, particularly China. For example, the women\\\\s basketball qualification was played in Belgrade, Serbia, instead of Foshan, China. The Asia & Oceania boxing qualification tournament, which was originally planned to be held from 3â14 February in Wuhan, China (the location of the original outbreak of the COVID-19 pandemic), instead took place in Amman, Jordan, at the beginning of March. The third round of the women\\\\s football qualification tournament was also affected, as the group matches formerly scheduled to be held in China were moved to Australia. The European boxing qualification began on 14 March 2020 in London, United Kingdom, but was suspended after two days of competition before being rescheduled for April 2021. It eventually resumed in June 2021 but was moved to Paris, France, because of renewed concerns over travel to the United Kingdom. Other qualifying events that were due to take place in March to June 2020 began to be postponed until later in the year and mid-2021 as part of a wider suspension of international sporting competitions in response to the pandemic. A multitude of Olympic sports were affected, including archery, baseball, cycling, handball, judo, rowing, sailing, volleyball, and water polo.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cMandatory doping tests were being severely restricted by the COVID-19 pandemic in early 2020. European anti-doping organizations raised concerns that blood and urine tests could not be performed and that mobilizing the staff necessary to do so before the end of the pandemic would be a health risk. Despite the need for extensive testing to take place in advance of the Games, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) stated that public health and safety were their topmost priorities. The Chinese anti-doping agency temporarily ceased testing on 3 February 2020, with a planned resumption of phased testing towards the end of the month, and the anti-doping organizations in the United States, France, Great Britain, and Germany had reduced their testing activities by the end of March\\\\c\\\\cThe Tokyo Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games (TOCOG) released a statement on 2 March 2020, confirming that preparations for the upcoming Tokyo Olympics were continuing as planned. On 23 March, both Canada and Australia indicated that they would withdraw from the Games if they were not postponed by a year. On the same day, Japanese prime minister Shinzo Abe stated he would support a proposed postponement, citing that ensuring athlete safety was paramount, and veteran IOC member and former vice president Dick Pound said that he expected the Games to be postponed\\\\c\\\\cThe IOC and TOCOG released a joint statement on 24 March 2020, announcing that the 2020 Summer Olympics and Paralympics would be rescheduled to a date beyond 2020 but not later than summer 2021. They stated that the Games could stand as a beacon of hope to the world during these troubled times, and that the Olympic flame could become the light at the end of the tunnel in which the world finds itself at present. Prime Minister Abe stated that IOC president Thomas Bach responded with 100% agreement to his proposal to delay the Games. For continuity and marketing purposes, it was agreed that the Games would still be branded as Tokyo 2020 despite the change in schedule\\\\c\\\\cOn 30 March 2020, the IOC and TOCOG announced that they had reached an agreement on the new dates for the 2020 Summer Olympics, which would begin with the opening ceremony on 23 July 2021 and end with the closing ceremony on 8 August 2021. The subsequent Winter Olympics in Beijing are scheduled to begin on 4 February 2022, less than six months later. Shortly before the postponement was confirmed, the IOC and Tokyo 2020 organizers formed a task force named Here We Go with the remit to address any issues arising from postponing the Games, such as sponsorship and accommodation. The organizers confirmed that all athletes who had already qualified for Tokyo 2020 would keep their qualification slots\\\\c\\\\cHealth experts expressed concern in April 2020 that the Games might have to be cancelled if the pandemic should persist. In an interview, the then president of TOCOG and former Japanese prime minister, YoshiroÌ Mori, asserted that the Games would be scrapped if they could not go ahead in 2021. On 29 April 2020, Prime Minister Abe stated that the Games must be held in a way that shows the world has won its battle against the coronavirus pandemic. Thomas Bach acknowledged in an interview on 20 May 2020, that the job of reorganizing the Tokyo Games was a mammoth task and also admitted that the event would have to be cancelled altogether if it could not take place in the summer of 2021. However, both Mori and Bach expressed optimism about the Games going ahead\\\\c\\\\cA member of the Japanese COVID-19 Advisory Committee on the basic action policy co-authored a British Medical Journal editorial, which stated, holding Tokyo 2020 for domestic political and economic purposesâ ignoring scientific and moral imperativesâis contradictory to Japanâs commitment to global health and human security\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 January 2021, multiple sources reported that the Japanese government had privately concluded that the Games would have to be cancelled. The government dismissed the claims, stating that the reports were categorically untrue. The new Japanese prime minister Yoshihide Suga confirmed on 19 February that the G7 had given unanimous support for the postponed Games to go ahead as scheduled. President Biden supports Prime Minister Suga\\\\s efforts, the White House stated. It was reported in April 2021, just three months before the start of the Games, that there was still the option to cancel the Tokyo Olympics with the country having vaccinated less than 1% of its population, with tens of thousands of volunteers expected to take part and athletes not being required to quarantine after arriving in Japan. Prime Minister Suga dismissed these reports in an April 2021 press conference with President Biden, who continues to support Suga\\\\s determination to hold the Games. We respected the decision to delay the games last summer and the President proudly supports U.S. athletes, the White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said\\\\c\\\\cPublic support for the Games in Japan has decreased significantly amid a 2021 surge in COVID-19 cases in the country. Multiple organizations of medical professionals have voiced oppositions to the Games, while an opinion poll in April 2021 saw 40% of participants support the cancellation of the Games, and 33% support a second postponement. In May 2021, 83% of those polled supported the cancellation or postponement of the Games. The Tokyo Medical Practitioners Association is calling for the cancellation, stating that hospitals in Tokyo have their hands full and have almost no spare capacity in an open letter to the prime minister. At least nine out of 47 elected governors supported the cancellation of the Games. Nearly 37% of Japanese companies surveyed supported the cancellation of the Games, and 32% supported postponement\\\\c\\\\cKenji Utsunomiya, who had previously run for Governor of Tokyo, collected more than 351,000 signatures on a petition calling for the organisers to prioritise life over the Olympics. Japanese writers Jiro Akagawa and Fuminori Nakamura also called for the Games to be postponed or cancelled\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 May 2021, the Asahi Shimbun newspaper, which is a local sponsor of the Games, published an editorial calling for Prime Minister Suga to calmly and objectively assess the situation and decide on the cancellation of the event this summer. On 4 June it was reported that Japanese sponsors have proposed to the organisers for the Games to be postponed for several months, citing a comment by a corporate sponsor senior executive: It just makes much, much more sense from our perspective to hold the Games when there are more vaccinated people, the weather is cooler and maybe public opposition is lower\\\\c\\\\cIn July 2021, it was announced that all events in Tokyo are to be held behind closed doors with no spectators due to a new state of emergency. A poll by the Asahi Shimbun found that 55% of those surveyed supported the cancellation of the Olympics, and 68% felt that organisers would not be able to suitably control COVID-19 at the Games. The decision was also detrimental to local sponsors, which had planned in-person presences to promote their products during the Games; an executive of official sponsor Toyota stated that the company had pulled a television advertising campaign it had planned for the Games in Japan, citing that the Olympics were becoming an event that has not gained the publicâs understanding\\\\c\\\\cHad the games been cancelled, it would have been the first time since World War II that an Olympic event had been called off and the first games to be scrapped due to a circumstance that didn\\\\t have to do with war. A complete cancellation would have also cost Japan Â¥4.52 trillion (US$41.5 billion), based on operating expenses and loss of tourism activity\\\\c\\\\cAccording to an estimate conducted by professor emeritus Katsuhiro Miyamoto of Kansai University and reported by the NHK, the cost of delaying the 2020 Olympics by one year will be 640.8 billion yen (US$5.8 billion), taking maintenance expenditures for the unused facilities into account\\\\c\\\\cThe Tokyo Games are protected through the commercial insurance marketplace Lloyd\\\\s of London, by global reinsurers Munich Re and Swiss Re. The IOC takes out around $800 million of insurance for each Summer Olympics, with the total amount of loss insured for the 2020 Games likely to be more than $2 billion. The disruption caused by postponing the Games was covered by the insurance policy; those likely to make claims for their financial losses include local organizers, sponsors, hospitality firms, and travel providers. The total loss amount will not become clear until the Games have actually taken place\\\\c\\\\cHolders of tickets purchased from overseas prior to postponement will be entitled to refunds for both Olympic and Paralympic ticket purchases except for costs for cancelled hotel bookings. Although about 600,000 Olympic tickets and 300,000 Paralympic tickets will need to be refunded, organisers said that they would not release the costs for refunds. Reuters quoted industry sources who estimated that the Tokyo Olympics Committee had taken out US$500â800 million in insurance and that after accounting for costs such as rebooking sporting venues and the Olympic Village, little of that payout would be available to recoup the proceeds of lost and refunded ticket sales. The local organizers are responsible for ticket sales and use them to defray the costs of holding the games; ticket sales were expected to bring in approximately US$800 million, but actual sales will be close to zero\\\\c\\\\cThe Tokyo Organizing Committee was originally headed by former Japanese prime minister YoshiroÌ Mori, but he resigned in February 2021 due to backlash from sexist comments about women in meetings. Seiko Hashimoto was chosen to succeed him. Tamayo Marukawa, Minister for the Tokyo Olympic and Paralympic Games, was responsible for overseeing the preparations on behalf of the Japanese government\\\\c\\\\cThe Tokyo Metropolitan Government set aside a fund of Â¥400 billion (more than US$3.67 billion) to cover the cost of hosting the Games. The Japanese government was considering easing airspace restrictions to allow an increased slot capacity at both Haneda and Narita airports. A new railway line was planned to link both airports through an expansion of Tokyo Station, cutting travel time from Tokyo Station to Haneda from 30 minutes to 18 minutes, and from Tokyo Station to Narita from 55 minutes to 36 minutes; funded primarily by private investors, the line would cost Â¥400 billion. The East Japan Railway Company (JR East) was also planning a new route near Tamachi to Haneda Airport\\\\c\\\\cThere were plans to fund the accelerated completion of the Central Circular Route, Tokyo Gaikan Expressway, and Ken-OÌ Expressway, and the refurbishment of other major expressways in the area. The Yurikamome automated transit line was also to be extended from its existing terminal at Toyosu Station to a new terminal at Kachidoki Station, passing the site of the Olympic Village, although the line was not expected to have adequate capacity to serve major events in the Odaiba area on its own\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2018, the Tokyo Organizing Committee signed a partnership with the International Labour Organization to ensure decent work in the preparation of and during the 2020 Olympic Games\\\\c\\\\cIn June 2020, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, ToshiroÌ MutoÌ, stated that the committee was exploring options for streamlining the Games to achieve cost savings. On 25 September, the IOC and Tokyo Organizing Committee agreed to a suite of measures to simplify the Games\\\\ logistics, including a cut to non-athlete staff, use of online meetings, and streamlined transport, among others. The committee also outlined areas it would be exploring in order to maintain the health and safety of all participants\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2012, it was announced that former Tokyo\\\\s National Stadium, the central venue for the 1964 Summer Olympics, would undergo a Â¥100 billion renovation for the 2019 Rugby World Cup and the 2020 Summer Olympics. In November 2012, the Japan Sport Council announced it was taking bids for proposed stadium designs. Of the 46 finalists, Zaha Hadid Architects was awarded the project, which would replace the old stadium with a new 80,000-seat stadium. There was criticism of the Zaha Hadid designâwhich was compared to a bicycle helmet and regarded as clashing with the surrounding Meiji Shrineâand widespread disapproval of the costs, even with attempts to revise and optimize the design\\\\c\\\\cIn June 2015, the government announced it was planning to reduce the new stadium\\\\s permanent capacity to 65,000 in its athletics configuration (although with the option to add up to 15,000 temporary seats for football) as a further cost-saving measure. The original plans to build a retractable roof were also scrapped. As a result of public opposition to the increasing costs of the stadium, which reached Â¥252 billion, the government ultimately chose to reject Zaha Hadid\\\\s design entirely and selected a new design by Japanese architect Kengo Kuma. Inspired by traditional temples and with a lower profile, Kuma\\\\s design has a budget of Â¥149 billion. Changes in plans prevented the new stadium from being completed in time for the 2019 Rugby World Cup as originally intended. The National Stadium, which was inaugurated on 21 December 2019, will be named the Olympic Stadium during the Tokyo Games\\\\c\\\\cIn October 2018, the Board of Audit issued a report stating that the total cost of the venues could exceed US$25 billion\\\\c\\\\cOf the 33 competition venues in Tokyo, 28 are within 8 kilometers (5 miles) of the Olympic Village, with eleven new venues to be constructed. On 16 October 2019, the IOC announced that there were plans to re-locate the marathon and racewalking events to Sapporo for heat concerns. The plans were made official on 1 November 2019 after Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike accepted the IOC\\\\s decision, despite her belief that the events should have remained in Tokyo\\\\c\\\\cIn December 2018, the Japanese government chose to ban drones from flying over venues being used for the Olympic and Paralympic Games. A similar ban was also imposed for the 2019 Rugby World Cup, which Japan also hosted\\\\c\\\\cApplications for volunteering at the 2020 Olympic and Paralympic Games were accepted beginning on 26 September 2018. By 18 January 2019, a total of 204,680 applications had been received by the Tokyo Organizing Committee. Interviews to select the requisite number of volunteers began in February 2019, with training scheduled to take place in October 2019. The volunteers at the venues are to be known as Field Cast, and the volunteers in the city are to be known as City Cast. These names were chosen from a shortlist of four from an original 150 pairs of names; the other three shortlisted names were Shining Blue and Shining Blue Tokyo, Games Anchor and City Anchor, and Games Force and City Force. The names were chosen by the people who had applied to be volunteers at the Games\\\\c\\\\cAs of early June 2021, approximately 10,000 out of the 80,000 registered volunteers resigned from the Games. Media attributed the rise in pandemic cases as the reason for massive quitting. More volunteer assignments are expected to be cancelled due to the spectator ban\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2017, the Tokyo Organizing Committee announced an electronics recycling program in partnership with Japan Environmental Sanitation Center and NTT Docomo, soliciting donations of electronics such as mobile phones to be reclaimed as materials for the medals. Aiming to collect eight tonnes of metals to produce the medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games, collection boxes were deployed at public locations and NTT Docomo retail shops in April 2017. A design competition for the medals was launched in December of that year\\\\c\\\\cIn May 2018, the organizing committee reported that they had obtained half the required 2,700 kilograms of bronze but were struggling to obtain the required amount of silver; although bronze and silver medals purely utilize their respective materials, IOC requirements mandate that gold medals utilize silver as a base. The collection of bronze was completed in November 2018, with the remainder estimated to have been completed by March 2019\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 July 2019 (one year ahead of the originally scheduled opening ceremony), the designs of the medals were unveiled. The medals for the Olympic and Paralympic Games were designed by Junichi Kawanishi following a nationwide competition. A new feature shared with the Paralympic medals is that the ribbons contain one, two, or three silicone convex lines to distinguish gold, silver, and bronze medals, respectively\\\\c\\\\cDue to COVID-19 protocols, athletes will be presented with their medals on trays and asked to put them on themselves, rather than have them placed around their necks by a dignitary\\\\c\\\\cThe slogan of the 2020 Summer Olympics torch relay is Hope Lights Our Way\\\\c\\\\cAs determined by a 2009 IOC ruling that banned international torch relays for any future Olympic Games, the 2020 Summer Olympics torch was scheduled to only visit the two countries of Greece and the host nation Japan. The first phase of the relay began on 12 March 2020, with the traditional flame lighting ceremony at the Temple of Hera in Olympia, Greece. The torch then travelled to Athens, where the Greek leg of the relay culminated in a handover ceremony at the Panathenaic Stadium on 19 March, during which the torch was transferred to the Japanese contingent. The flame was placed inside a special lantern and transported from Athens International Airport on a chartered flight to Higashimatsushima in Japan. The torch was then expected to begin the second phase of its journey on 20 March, as it traveled for one week around the three most affected areas of the 2011 ToÌhoku earthquake and tsunamiâMiyagi, Iwate and Fukushimaâwhere it would go on display under the heading Flame of Recovery. After leaving Naraha on 26 March, the torch would commence its main relay around Japan, incorporating all 47 prefectural capitals\\\\c\\\\cAfter the decision to postpone the Games was made, the torch was placed again in a special lantern on display in the city of Fukushima for a month. After that, the lantern was transferred to the Tokyo prefecture, where it was kept safe until the restart of the relay in 2021. On 23 July 2020 (one year ahead of the rescheduled opening ceremony), a promotional video was released featuring Japanese swimmer Rikako Ikee carrying the lantern inside Japan National Stadium, drawing comparisons between emergence from the pandemic and her own return to sport after being diagnosed with leukemia. On 20 August 2020, it was announced that the torch relay would begin again in Naraha, Fukushima on 25 March 2021, nearly a year later than originally planned\\\\c\\\\cThe relay ended at Tokyo\\\\s National Stadium on 23 July, with tennis player Naomi Osaka lighting the Olympic cauldron at the finale of the opening ceremony\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2021, the IOC began releasing playbooks containing details on planned COVID-19 biosecurity protocols for athletes, officials, the press, and other staff, including standard protocols such as practicing social distancing, hygiene, the wearing of face masks (outside of training and competition for athletes), and being restricted from visiting bars, restaurants, shops, and other tourist areas around Greater Tokyo Area, or using public transport unless otherwise permitted. Participants will be asked to use Japan\\\\s COCOA Exposure Notification app and will be tested at least every four days. Athletes who test positive will be unable to compete and may be quarantined at a government facility (although leeway will be given in the event of false positives). Close contacts must also test negative in order to be cleared for competition. As the actions could spread infected droplets, athletes will be discouraged from excessive celebrations. The playbooks were criticized in a paper published by The New England Journal of Medicine in May 2021, for lacking scientifically rigorous risk assessment and failing to distinguish the various levels of risk faced by athletes. The playbook states the athletes must arrive up to five days prior to the start of the competition and have to leave within 48 hours once they have been eliminated from the sport or competitions have been concluded\\\\c\\\\cThe IOC is recommending the vaccination of athletes if they are available, but vaccines will not be required, and the IOC is recommending against athletes jumping the queue in order to obtain priority over essential populations. On 12 March 2021, Thomas Bach announced that in nations where they are approved for use, the Chinese Olympic Committee had offered to cover the costs of the Chinese CoronaVac and Sinopharm vaccines for athletes competing in the 2020 Summer Olympics and 2022 Winter Olympics, and purchase two doses for their nation\\\\s general public for each vaccinated athlete. On 6 May 2021, Pfizer announced that it would donate doses of its vaccine to NOCs competing in Tokyo\\\\c\\\\cApproximately 93,000 athletes and officials are exempt from the quarantine rules upon arriving in Japan, provided that they remain in areas separated from the local population. With around 300,000 local staff and volunteers entering and exiting these bubbles, and 20,000 vaccine doses allocated for this group, it has led to concerns of COVID-19 spreading both during the Games and when teams return to their countries\\\\c\\\\cDue to international travel restrictions, the organizing committee announced that no international guests (including spectators) would be allowed to attend the Games. As per existing guidance for spectator sports in Japan, spectators would be asked to refrain from cheering or shouting. On 19 June 2021, Governor Koike announced that plans for public viewing events for the Games had been scrapped, in order to use the planned venues (such as Yoyogi Park) as mass vaccination sites instead. On 21 June, it was announced that all venues would be capped at a maximum of 10,000 ticketed spectators or 50% capacity, whichever is lower\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 July 2021, the new TOCOG president Seiko Hashimoto warned that there was still a possibility of the Games being held behind closed doors because of rising COVID-19 cases in the country. Japan\\\\s slow vaccination rate had been of particular concern. A simulation run by the University of Tokyo in May 2021 projected that a new wave of infections could peak in mid-October if the Games went on after the existing state of emergency in Tokyo had expired\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 July 2021, after Tokyo recorded 920 new COVID-19 cases (its highest increase since May), Prime Minister Suga declared a new state of emergency in the Tokyo area from 12 July through 22 August (ending only two days before the Paralympics\\\\ opening ceremony), and announced that all events at venues in the area will therefore be held behind closed doors with no spectators permitted. Hashimoto stated that it is extremely regrettable that the Games will be staged in a very limited manner in the face of the spread of novel coronavirus infections. President of the IOC Thomas Bach stated that we will support any measure which is necessary to have a safe and secure Olympic and Paralympic Games for the Japanese people and all the participants\\\\c\\\\cThe announcement stated that spectators will still be allowed at events being held outside of Tokyo, subject to the approval by local health authorities and the aforementioned 50%/10,000-spectator limit. The prefectures of Fukushima and Hokkaido stated that they will prohibit spectators at events held in the areas. Ibaraki Prefecture will also prohibit general spectators but students from that area allow to enter as a part of school program. The opening ceremony is expected to be limited to fewer than 1,000 VIP guests, including IOC representatives and dignitaries. On 16 July, it was reported that Bach had asked Prime Minister Suga about the possibility that restrictions on spectators could be eased later on if COVID-19 conditions improve in Tokyo\\\\c\\\\cThe opening ceremony tickets were expected to range from Â¥12,000 to Â¥300,000, with a maximum price of Â¥130,000 for the finals of the athletics track and field events. The average ticket price is Â¥7,700, with half the tickets being sold for up to Â¥8,000. A symbolic ticket price of Â¥2,020 is expected for families, groups resident in Japan, and in conjunction with a school program. Tickets will be sold through 40,000 shops in Japan and by mail order to Japanese addresses through the Internet. International guests, had they been allowed, would have needed to visit Japan during the sales period, or arrange to buy tickets through a third party such as a travel agent\\\\c\\\\cTickets went on general sale in Japan in the autumn of 2019 and were expected to be sold globally from June 2020; however, this plan was suspended when the Games were postponed on 24 March 2020. The Tokyo Organizing Committee confirmed that tickets already purchased would remain valid for the same sessions according to the new schedule and that refunds were also being offered\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 March 2021, it was announced that due to COVID-19-related concerns, no international guests would be allowed to attend the 2020 Olympics or Paralympics. This includes both spectators, as well as the friends and family of athletes. All overseas ticketholders will be refunded. Hashimoto cited uncertainties surrounding international travel restrictions, and goals to preserve the safety of all participants and spectators, and not place a burden on the health care system. It was ultimately announced in July that no spectators will be allowed at any events held in Tokyo, Fukushima and Hokkaido\\\\c\\\\cA cultural programme known as Nippon Festival was scheduled to coincide with the Olympics and Paralympics, running from April to September 2021 as a series of streaming events held by the Tokyo Organizing Committee and other partners. The events are reflecting the themes of Participation and Interaction, Towards the Realisation of an Inclusive Society and Reconstruction of the Tohoku Region. The programme was downsized and reformatted due to COVID-19 and the postponement of the Games. One of these events was a concert held on 18 July, which featured J-rock band Wanima, choreography by dancers Aio Yamada and Tuki Takamura, and the presentation of animated creatures based on illustrations embodying the thoughts and emotions of people from across the world\\\\c\\\\cThe original plans for Nippon Festival included events such as Kabuki x Opera (a concert that would have featured stage actor Ichikawa EbizoÌ XI, opera singers Anna Pirozzi and Erwin Schrott, and the Tokyo Philharmonic Orchestra), an arts and culture festival focusing on disabilities, and a special two-day exhibition sumo tournament at the RyoÌgoku Kokugikan shortly after the Olympicsâwhich would have differed significantly from the traditional bi-monthly Honbasho tournaments, and featured special commentary in English and Japanese to help explain to spectators the customs and traditions of professional sumo, which are deeply rooted in the Shinto religion\\\\c\\\\cThe opening ceremony was held on 23 July 2021 in the Olympic Stadium in Tokyo. It included the traditional Parade of Nations. Emperor Naruhito formally opened the Games, and at the end of the torch relay the Olympic cauldron was lit by Japanese tennis player Naomi Osaka\\\\c\\\\cThe official program for the 2020 Summer Olympics was approved by the IOC executive board on 9 June 2017. IOC president Thomas Bach stated that the goal for the Tokyo Summer Olympics was to give them a more youthful and urban appeal, and to increase the number of female participants\\\\c\\\\cThe Games will feature 339 events in 33 different sports, encompassing a total of 50 disciplines. Alongside the five new sports that are expected to be introduced in Tokyo, fifteen new events within existing sports are also planned, including 3Ã3 basketball, freestyle BMX, and the return of madison cycling, as well as new mixed events in several sports.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cIn the list below, the number of events in each discipline is noted in parentheses.[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\cOn 12 February 2013, with a remit to control the cost of the Games and ensure they are relevant to sports fans of all generations, the IOC Executive Board recommended the removal of one of the 26 sports contested at the 2012 Summer Olympics, leaving a vacancy which the IOC would seek to fill at the 125th IOC Session. Five sports were shortlisted for removal, including canoe, field hockey, modern pentathlon, taekwondo, and wrestling. In the final round of voting by the Executive Board, eight members voted to remove wrestling from the Olympic programme. Hockey and taekwondo were both tied in second with three votes each\\\\c\\\\cThe decision to drop wrestling surprised many media outlets, given that the sport\\\\s role in the Olympics dates back to the ancient Olympic Games, and was included in the original programme for the modern Games. The New York Times felt that the decision was based on the shortage of well-known talent and the absence of women\\\\s events in the sport. Out of the shortlist from the IOC vote, Wrestling was duly added to the shortlist of applicants for inclusion in the 2020 Games, alongside the seven new sports that were put forward for consideration\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 May 2013, it was announced that three of the eight sports under consideration had made the final shortlist: baseball/softball, squash and wrestling. The other five sports were rejected at this point: karate, roller sports, sport climbing, wakeboarding, and wushu. At the 125th IOC Session on 8 September 2013, wrestling was chosen to be included in the Olympic programme for 2020 and 2024. Wrestling secured 49 votes, while baseball/softball and squash received 24 votes and 22 votes respectively\\\\c\\\\cWith the adoption of the Olympic Agenda 2020 in December 2014, the IOC shifted from a sport-based approach to the Olympic programme to an event-based programmeâproviding additional flexibility for the host organizing committee to propose the addition of sports to the programme to improve local interest. As a result of these changes, a shortlist of eight new proposed sports was unveiled on 22 June 2015, consisting of baseball/softball, bowling, karate, roller sports, sport climbing, squash, surfing, and wushu. On 28 September 2015, the Tokyo Organizing Committee submitted their shortlist of five proposed sports to the IOC: baseball/softball, karate, sport climbing, surfing, and skateboarding. These five new sports were approved on 3 August 2016 by the IOC during the 129th IOC Session in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, and are to be included in the sports program for 2020 only, bringing the total number of sports at the 2020 Olympics to 33\\\\c\\\\cA total of 56 test events were scheduled to take place in the run-up to the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics. Two of the events were held in late 2018, but the main test event schedule commenced in June 2019 and was originally due to be completed in May 2020 prior to the start of the Olympics. Several of the events were incorporated into pre-existing championships, but some have been newly created specifically to serve as Olympic test events for the 2020 Summer Games\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2019, it was announced that the test events would be branded under the banner Ready, Steady, Tokyo. The Tokyo Organizing Committee is responsible for 22 of the test events, with the remaining events being arranged by national and international sports federations. The first test event was World Sailing\\\\s World Cup Series, held at Enoshima in September 2018. The last scheduled event is the Tokyo Challenge Track Meet, which was originally due to take place at the Olympic Stadium on 6 May 2020\\\\c\\\\cAll test events originally scheduled to take place from 12 March 2020 onwards were postponed due to COVID-19, with the test event calendar to be reviewed during the preparations for the rescheduled Games\\\\c\\\\cThe Republic of Macedonia has competed under the provisional name Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia in every Summer and Winter Games since its debut in 1996 because of the disputed status of its official name. The naming disputes with Greece ended in 2018 with the signing of the Prespa agreement, and the country was officially renamed North Macedonia in February 2019. The new name was immediately recognized by the IOC, although the Olympic Committee of North Macedonia (NMOC) was not officially adopted until February 2020. The NMOC sent a delegation to the 2020 Winter Youth Olympics in January 2020, but the Tokyo Games are North Macedonia\\\\s first appearance at the Summer Olympics under its new name. Since competing as Swaziland ten times at the Summer and Winter Olympics, Eswatini made its debut under that name after the renaming of the country by the king in 2018\\\\c\\\\cOn 9 December 2019, the World Anti-Doping Agency (WADA) banned Russia from all international sport for a period of four years, after the Russian government was found to have tampered with lab data that it provided to WADA in January 2019 as a condition of the Russian Anti-Doping Agency being reinstated. As a result of the ban, WADA plans to allow individually cleared Russian athletes to take part in the 2020 Summer Olympics under a neutral banner, as instigated at the 2018 Winter Olympics, but they will not be permitted to compete in team sports. WADA Compliance Review Committee head Jonathan Taylor stated that the IOC would not be able to use Olympic Athletes from Russia (OAR) as it did in 2018, emphasizing that neutral athletes cannot be portrayed as representing a specific country. Russia later filed an appeal to the Court of Arbitration for Sport (CAS) against the WADA decision. After reviewing the case on appeal, CAS ruled on 17 December 2020 to reduce the penalty that WADA had placed on Russia. Instead of banning Russia from sporting events, the ruling allowed Russia to participate at the Olympics and other international events, but for a period of two years, the team cannot use the Russian name, flag, or anthem and must present themselves as Neutral Athlete or Neutral Team. The ruling does allow for team uniforms to display Russia on the uniform as well as the use of the Russian flag colors within the uniform\\\\s design, although the name should be up to equal predominance as the Neutral Athlete/Team designation\\\\c\\\\cOn 19 February 2021, it was announced that Russia would compete under the acronym ROC after the name of the Russian Olympic Committee although the name of the committee itself in full could not be used to refer to the delegation. The ROC team would be represented by the flag of the Russian Olympic Committee\\\\c\\\\cOn 6 April 2021, North Korea announced it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics due to COVID-19 concerns. This will mark North Korea\\\\s first absence in the Summer Olympics since 1988. On 21 July 2021, Guinea announced it would not participate in the 2020 Summer Olympics allegedly due to COVID-19 concerns, though media outlets suggested that financial considerations may have been the real motivating factor. Guinea later reversed the decision and announced it would participate\\\\c\\\\cThe following 205 national Olympic committee teams and the IOC Refugee Olympic Team have qualified (including the 104 universality places guaranteed in athletics, under which all 206 NOCs may send competitors regardless of qualification).[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\c11,656 athletes from 206 NOCs:[citation needed]\\\\c\\\\c  *   Host nation\\\\c\\\\cThere have been two podium sweeps, as follows:\\\\c\\\\cThe 2020 schedule by session was approved by the IOC Executive Board on 18 July 2018, with the exception of swimming, diving, and artistic swimming. A more detailed schedule by event was released on 16 April 2019, still omitting a detailed schedule for the boxing events. A detailed boxing schedule was released in late 2019\\\\c\\\\cThe original schedule was from 22 July to 9 August 2020. To postpone the Olympics until 2021, all events were delayed by 364 days (one day less than a full year to preserve the same days of the week), giving a new schedule of 21 July to 8 August 2021\\\\c\\\\cPer the historical precedent of swimming at the 2008 Summer Olympics in Beijing and figure skating at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang, swimming finals are scheduled to be held in the morning to allow live primetime broadcasts in the Americas. NBC paid substantial fees for rights to the Olympics, so the IOC has allowed NBC to influence event scheduling to maximize U.S. television ratings when possible. On 7 May 2014, NBC agreed to a US$7.75 billion contract extension to air the Olympics through the 2032 games, which is one of the IOC\\\\s major sources of revenue. Japanese broadcasters were said to have criticized the decision, as swimming is one of the most popular Olympic events in the country\\\\c\\\\cThe official emblems for the 2020 Olympics and Paralympics were unveiled on 25 April 2016; designed by Asao Tokolo, who won a nationwide design contest, it takes the form of a ring in an indigo-colored checkerboard pattern. The design is meant to express a refined elegance and sophistication that exemplifies Japan. The checkered design resembles a pattern called ichimatsu moyo that was popular during the Edo period in Japan from 1603 to 1867.  The designs replaced a previous emblem which had been scrapped after allegations that it plagiarized the logo of the TheÌaÌtre de LieÌge in Belgium. The Games\\\\ bid slogan is Discover Tomorrow (Japanese: æªæ¥(ããã)ãã¤ããã, romanized: Ashita o tsukamoÌ). While ashita literally means \\\\tomorrow\\\\, it is intentionally spelled as mirai \\\\future\\\\. The official slogan United by Emotion was unveiled on 17 February 2020. The slogan will be used solely in English\\\\c\\\\cThe official mascot of the 2020 Summer Olympics is Miraitowa, a figure with blue-checkered ichimatsu moyo patterns inspired by the Games\\\\ official emblem. Its fictional characteristics include the ability to teleport. Created by Japanese artist Ryo Taniguchi, the mascots were selected from a competition process which took place in late 2017 and early 2018. A total of 2,042 candidate designs were submitted to the Tokyo Organizing Committee, which selected three pairs of unnamed mascot designs to present to Japanese elementary school students for the final decision. The results of the selection were announced on 28 February 2018, and the mascots were named on 22 July 2018. Miraitowa is named after the Japanese words for future and eternity, and Someity is named after someiyoshino, a type of cherry blossom. Someity\\\\s name also refers to the English phrase so mighty. The mascots are expected to help finance the Tokyo Games through merchandizing and licensing deals\\\\c\\\\cNaoki SatoÌ composed the music for victory ceremonies at the 2020 Olympic Games in Tokyo\\\\c\\\\cAlongside the main Emblem blue, the five other colors used in the branding of the 2020 Games are   Kurenai red,   Ai blue,   Sakura pink,   Fuji purple, and   Matsuba green. These five traditional colors of Japan are used as sub-colors to create points of difference in the color variations\\\\c\\\\cSouth Korea asked the IOC to ban the Japanese Rising Sun Flag from the 2020 Summer Olympics, because South Korea\\\\s Ministry of Culture, Sports and Tourism claims the flag is a symbol of Japan\\\\s imperialist past and recalls historic scars and pain for people of Korea just as the swastika reminds Europeans of the nightmare of World War II. Use of the flag in international sporting events such as the Olympic Games is quite controversial, as it was used for waging aggressive war against many countries in Pacific regions including the Attack on Pearl Harbor. However, the flag has been utilized since before World War II and it is still used by the Japan Maritime Self-Defense Force and a variant by the Japan Self-Defense Forces. South Korea did not formally raise objections against the flag until 2011. According to the Associated Press, the IOC issued a statement in response to South Korea\\\\s request, saying, sports stadiums should be free of any political demonstration. When concerns arise at games time we look at them on a case by case basis. Meanwhile, the South Korean team put up a provocative banner on the balcony of the Olympic village, reminiscent of the 16th century war between Japan and Korea. The Korean team removed the banner after the IOC warned it was a violation of the Olympic Charter. According to the South Korea\\\\s Olympic Committee, the IOC will apply the same rules if the Rising Sun Flag is raised. The South Korean team provided its own food service for the team, claiming that the food served in the Olympic village might be contaminated with radiation\\\\c\\\\cRussian and South Korean officials took issue with a map of the torch relay on the Games\\\\ official website, which depicted the disputed Liancourt Rocks (governed by South Korea) and Kuril Islands (governed by Russia since 1945) as part of Japan\\\\c\\\\cPortions of the Games are scheduled for locations that were impacted by the 2011 ToÌhoku earthquake and tsunami and Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster. The Olympics torch relay was planned to begin in Fukushima, while Olympic baseball and softball matches are scheduled to be played at Fukushima Stadium, and some football matches are expected to be played in Rifuâan outskirt of Sendai, an area impacted by the earthquake and tsunami. The hosting of events in these locations has been promoted as a means of furthering recovery in the regions (the rescheduled Games will mark the events\\\\ 10th anniversary), with the Games as a whole sometimes being promoted as the Recovery Olympics (FukkoÌ Gorin (å¾©èäºè¼ª)). However, the organization of events in these regions has faced criticism; Fukushima is considered safe by the World Health Organization and the United Nations, although scientific studies on the safety of the area are currently disputed. Some ToÌhoku residents have questioned the decision to use the region as a host site, arguing that preparations for the Games have slowed recovery efforts, and that the region has lost workers to projects associated with the Games\\\\c\\\\cA petition which obtained over 140,000 signatures was delivered to the Japanese Embassy expressing concerns over claims of using tropical wood sourced from Shin Yang, a Malaysian company with a record of human rights abuses, illegal logging and rainforest destruction. In February 2018 the Olympics Organizing Committee admitted that 87% of plywood panels used to build the new national stadium was sourced from endangered rainforests, a decision that received criticism in Borneo and Japan\\\\c\\\\cAfter consulting the organization\\\\s Athletes\\\\ Commission on guidelines prohibiting protests at the Olympics, such as protesting against human rights abuses or taking a knee on the podium, the IOC decided to uphold the ban\\\\c\\\\cOfficials have said that by early June, about 10,000 of the 80,000 registered volunteers had quit. There\\\\s no doubt that one of the reasons is concern over coronavirus infections, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee said, also stating he does not believe this will impact the operation of the Games\\\\c\\\\cThe Nomura Research Institute estimated that cancelling the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics in 2021 would cost around 1.81 trillion yen ($17 billion), less than the economic damages projected if another state of emergency is declared, noting that a decision to hold the games should be made based on the impact on infection risks, not from the standpoint of economic loss\\\\c\\\\cEmperor Naruhito, Honorary Patron for the Tokyo 2020 Games, is said to be extremely worried about the current status of coronavirus infections and concerned that while there are voices of anxiety among the public, the holding (of the events) may lead to the expansion of infections\\\\c\\\\cOn 23 July, hundreds of anti-Olympic protestors gathered outside the Japan National Stadium before the opening ceremony. Security guards blocked reporters from leaving the stadium to interview protestors\\\\c\\\\cThe opening ceremony music included arrangements of video game soundtracks originating in Japan; however, this included Dragon Quest series music composed by Koichi Sugiyama, who The Daily Beast described as notoriously homophobic and ultranationalist, leading to further criticism of the Organizing Committee\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 July, Indian news outlet ANI wrongly reported that Hou Zhihui of China, the new women\\\\s 49 kg weighlifting champion, would be tested by the International Testing Agency (ITA) for doping, according to ANI\\\\s unnamed source. Huo Zhihui had won gold in the 49 kg women\\\\s weightlifting event, against India\\\\s Mirabai Chanu, who won silver. The article also stated that Mirabai Chanu would be upgraded to a gold medal if the tests were positive. This report was subsequently propagated across other news networks, including The Economic Times, Business Standard, India.com and Taiwan News. The World Anti-Doping Agency and ITA debunked the reports, saying they knew nothing of such tests being carried out and that any developments would be transparently reported on their site. On 30 July, ANI reported that no such test occurred, and that they had made an inadvertent error while reporting the news. As of 3 August, ANI\\\\s original report of the disavowed test remains on its website\\\\c\\\\cSeveral controversial issues occurred in the preparations for the events, and several members of the Organizing Committee resigned as a  result of them\\\\c\\\\cThe official emblems of the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics were designed by KenjiroÌ Sano [ja] and unveiled in July 2015, but they were withdrawn and replaced until next year, following plagiarism accusations. The lawsuit by Olivier Debie, who claimed that his design was plagiarized, was later dropped, with the designer citing escalating legal costs\\\\c\\\\cOn 10 December 2018, the French financial crimes office began an investigation of Tsunekazu Takeda, the president of the Japanese Olympic Committee, concerning a 2013 scheme to obtain votes from African IOC members in support of Tokyo as host for the 2020 Olympics instead of Istanbul or Madrid. In March 2020, a Japanese businessman admitted to giving gifts, including cameras and watches, to IOC officials in order to lobby for their support of Tokyo\\\\s bid to host the Olympic Games\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2021, the TOCOG president YoshiroÌ Mori resigned, facing both domestic and international criticisms over his sexist remarks. The following president Seiko Hashimoto\\\\s previous conduct has also drawn criticisms, leading her to comment I regret it and think I should be careful on one of the accusations. In May, a top Japanese government adviser, Prof. Yoichi Takahashi, resigned following backlash over his tweets joking about Japan\\\\s pandemic ripple\\\\c\\\\cThe head creative director for the opening and closing ceremonies, Hiroshi Sasaki [ja], resigned in March, after making demeaning comments about Naomi Watanabe\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 July 2021, the Organizing Committee announced the creative team for the opening and closing ceremonies of the Olympics and Paralympics, and included Keigo Oyamada of Cornelius as a composer for the opening ceremony. A large amount of people on social media said he was ineligible for such a role because he is widely known for his past bullying of people with apparent disabilities, such as Down syndrome. Such abuses on his peers when at school included forcing them to eat their excrement and masturbate in front of other students, and he himself often boasted about the disability abuse stories in several interviews. On 16 July, a week before the opening ceremony, the Organizing Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games announced their support of him as a composer and vowed not to change his selection for the ceremonies. ToshiroÌ MutoÌ, the chief executive of the Organizing Committee, said he wanted Oyamada to remain involved. Growing criticism forced Oyamada to announce his resignation on 19 July\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 July, Japanese media reported that KentaroÌ Kobayashi, the director of the opening and closing ceremonies after Sasaki resigned, made a joke about the Holocaust in a script for his comedy in 1998, saying Let\\\\s play Holocaust. The Simon Wiesenthal Center, a Jewish human rights organization, condemned the joke, stating that any person, no matter how creative, does not have the right to mock the victims of the Nazi genocide. On 22 July, the day before the opening ceremony, the Organizing Committee announced they would dismiss Kobayashi. On the eve of the opening ceremony, Yoshihide Suga, the Prime Minister of Japan and the Supreme Advisor of the Organizing Committee, described Kobayashi\\\\s jokes as outrageous and unacceptable, but also said that the opening ceremony, which was directed by Kobayashi, should proceed as planned\\\\c\\\\cOn 23 July, the day of the opening ceremony, some media reported that Latyr Sy, a Senegalese artist, wrote on his Facebook page a denunciation of the Organizing Committee for canceling his performance in the opening ceremony due to him being African. Sy said of the Organizing Committee, It\\\\s totally racist. At a regular press conference held the next morning, Masanori Takaya [ja], a spokesperson of the organizing committee, said Sy\\\\s claim was completely different from the facts, and said We had planned a music part in which many singers would participate, but due to infectious disease control and budget, we canceled the part itself. Therefore we canceled the appearance of all the participants in the music part. That is the background of that story\\\\c\\\\cSony and Panasonic are partnering with NHK to develop broadcasting standards for 8K resolution television, with a goal to release 8K television sets in time for the 2020 Summer Olympics. In early 2019, Italian broadcaster RAI announced its intention to deploy 8K broadcasting for the Games. Telecom company NTT Docomo signed a deal with Finland\\\\s Nokia to provide 5G-ready baseband networks in Japan in time for the Games\\\\c\\\\cThe Tokyo Olympics are scheduled to be broadcast in the United States by NBCUniversal networks, as part of a US$4.38 billion agreement that began at the 2014 Winter Olympics in Sochi. The United States Olympic & Paralympic Committee asserts that a right of abatement clause in the contract was triggered by the delay of the Games to 2021, requiring the IOC to negotiate in good faith an equitable reduction in the applicable broadcast rights payments by NBC, which remains one of IOC\\\\s biggest revenue streams. According to NBCUniversal CEO Jeff Shell, the Tokyo games could be the most profitable Olympics in NBC\\\\s history\\\\c\\\\cIn Europe, this will be the first Summer Olympics under the IOC\\\\s exclusive pan-European rights deal with Eurosport, which began at the 2018 Winter Olympics and is contracted to run through 2024. The rights for the 2020 Summer Olympics cover almost all of Europe; a pre-existing deal with a marketer excludes Russia. Eurosport plans to sub-license coverage to free-to-air networks in each territory, and other channels owned by Discovery, Inc. subsidiaries. In the United Kingdom, these are set to be the last Games with rights owned primarily by the BBC, although as a condition of a sub-licensing agreement due to carry into the 2022 and 2024 Games, Eurosport holds exclusive pay television rights. In France, these will be the last Games whose rights are primarily owned by France TeÌleÌvisions. Eurosport is scheduled to debut as pay television rightsholder, after Canal+ elected to sell its pay television rights as a cost-saving measure\\\\c\\\\cIn Canada, the 2020 Games are scheduled to be shown on CBC/Radio-Canada platforms, Sportsnet, TSN and TLN.

Simultaneously, Taliban forces took control of Balkh and encircled Mazar-i-Sharif, the capital of Balkh Province. On 23 June, the Taliban and Afghan forces clashed inside Pul-e Khumri\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 June, the Taliban took control of the Shinwari District and the Ghorband District in Parwan province north of Kabul. That same day NBC News reported that the Taliban were surprised at the speed of their advance and had avoided capturing some targets so as not to run afoul of the U.S., and the Afghan government launched a program called National Mobilization that aimed to arm militia groups to fight the Taliban. Meanwhile, Taliban deputy emir Sirajuddin Haqqani issued a series of instructions on Voice of Jihad for the governance of territories seized in the offensive. FDD\\\\s Long War Journal researcher Thomas Joscelyn argued that Haqqani\\\\s statements read like those that would be issued by the head of a nation\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 June, Chaki Wardak District and Saydabad District fell to the Taliban after at least 50 Afghan troops surrendered and were captured by the Taliban. On the same day Rustaq District, Shortepa District and the Arghistan District fell to the Taliban.

All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar\\\\s air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control.

Civilians have been the main targets of attacks by Islamist militants. The main insurgent faction is Ansar al-Sunna, a native extremist faction with tenuous international connections. From mid-2018, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) has allegedly become active in northern Mozambique as well, and claimed its first attack against Mozambican security forces in June 2019. In addition, bandits have exploited the rebellion to carry out raids. As of 2020, the insurgency is thought to be intensifying, as in the first half of 2020 there were nearly as many attacks carried out as in the whole of 2019\\\\c\\\\cAnsar al-Sunna (English: Supporters of the Tradition) is similar to the name of an Iraqi Sunni insurgent group that fought against US troops between 2003 and 2007. Locals call them al-Shabaab but they are a separate organization from Somali Al-Shabaab. The militants are known to speak Portuguese, the official language of Mozambique, Kimwane, the local language, and Swahili, the lingua franca language spoken in the Great Lakes region. Reports also state that members are mostly Mozambicans from Mocimboa da Praia, Palma and Macomia districts, but also include foreign nationals from Tanzania and Somalia\\\\c\\\\cAnsar al-Sunna, also known by its original name Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jamo (translated adepts of the prophetic tradition), was initially a religious movement in northern districts of Cabo Delgado which first appeared around 2015. It was formed by followers of the radical Kenyan cleric Aboud Rogo, who was killed in 2012. Thereafter, some members of his movement settled down in Kibiti, Tanzania, before moving into Mozambique\\\\c\\\\cAnsar al-Sunna claims that Islam as practised in Mozambique has been corrupted and no longer follows the teachings of Muhammad. The movement\\\\s members consequently entered traditional mosques with weapons in order to threaten others to follow their own radical beliefs. The movement is also anti-Christian, anti-Animist and anti-Western, and has tried to prevent people from attending hospitals or schools which it considers secular and anti-Islamic. This behavior alienated much of the local population instead of converting them to Ahlu Sunnah Wa-Jamo, so that the movement\\\\s members broke away and formed their own places of worship. Over time, the group became increasingly violent: It called for Sharia law to be implemented in the country, no longer recognized the Mozambican government, and started to form hidden camps in Macomia District, MociÌmboa da Praia District, and Montepuez District. There, Ansar al-Sunna militants were trained by ex-policemen, and ex-frontier guards who had been fired and held grudges against the government. The movement also contacted other Islamist militants in East Africa, and reportedly hired trainers from Somalia, Tanzania, and Kenya. Some of the Ansar al-Sunna militants have also journeyed abroad to receive direct training by other militant groups\\\\c\\\\cThe militants are not unified, but split into different cells which do not appear to coordinate their actions. By August 2018, the Mozambican police had identified six men as leaders of the militants in Cabo Delgado: Abdul Faizal, Abdul Raim, Abdul Remane, Ibn Omar, Salimo, and Nuno Remane. Ansar al-Sunna funds itself through heroin, contraband and ivory trade\\\\c\\\\cWhile religion does play a fundamental role in the conflict, analysts believe the most important factors in the insurgency are widespread social, economic and political problems in Mozambique. Unemployment and especially youth unemployment are considered the main causes for locals to join the Islamist rebels. Increasing inequalities have led many young people to be easily attracted by such a radical movement, as Ansar al-Sunna promises that its form of Islam will act as antidote to the existing corrupt, elitist rule. Most rebels belong to the Mwani and Makwa ethnic groups that are native to Cabo Delgado; civilians belonging to these peoples have expressed sympathy for the insurgents. In general, the province lacks infrastructure and the state is underrepresented, easing the spread of the insurgency\\\\c\\\\cOn 5 October, a pre-dawn raid targeted 3 police stations in the town of MociÌmboa da Praia. It was led by 30 armed members, who killed 17 people, including two police officers and a community leader. 14 of the perpetrators were captured. During this brief occupation of MociÌmboa da Praia, the perpetrators stole firearms and ammunition and told residents that they reject state health and education, and refused to pay taxes.

Two airstrikes aimed at destroying military equipment captured by the Talibans from Afghan security forces; one artillery gun and one military vehicle were destroyed. Meanwhile, the battle for Kandahar city continued, with the settlement being essentially besieged by the rebels. All surrounding districts save for Daman District had fallen under Taliban control, and only Kandahar\\\\s air field (crucial for supplying the local security forces) remained under full government control. According to the FDD\\\\s Long War Journal, the potential fall of Daman District to the insurgents would make it extremely difficult for the government forces to hold onto Kandahar city. On 22 July, 100 people were killed in a mass shooting in Spin Boldak, Kandahar Province. However, pro-government forces also scored victories in Bamyan Province, as local militias and the police retook the districts of Saighan and Kahmard from the Taliban, and in Herat Province, where the government recaptured Karakh District\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 July, the government imposed a curfew between 10 p.m. in all but three provinces of the country in order to curb violence and reduce the movements and advances of the Taliban\\\\c\\\\cOn 26 July, a report by representative of the United Nations Deborah Lyons showed a sharp increase in civilian deaths as a consequence of the fighting between the government and the Taliban.

Among others, Herat\\\\s important Karakh District was again overrun by the rebels. The insurgents also cut the road between Herat International Airport and Herat city, although the airport remained under government control. The Long War Journal argued that the government\\\\s ability to keep control of Herat city without the airport supplying the defenders was questionable. Meanwhile, Kandahar city remained contested\\\\c\\\\cFrom 1 to 2 August, the Safian, Qala-e-Kohneh and Kariz areas on the outskirts of Lashkar Gah fell to the Taliban. Clashes between Taliban and the government also took place in the suburbs of the city, with the Afghan Air Force and United States Air Force attacking Taliban positions.

On the same day, heavy fighting was reported in Jowzjan Province as the Taliban entered the provincial capital, Sheberghan. The Taliban confirmed responsibility for the killing of Minapal and warned that it would target senior administration officials in retaliation for increasing airstrikes. On the same day, the Taliban captured the provincial capital of Nimroz Province, Zaranj, making it the first capture by the Taliban of a provincial capital since the 2001 American invasion. The rebels proceeded to open the local prisons, allowing many inmates to escape. As Zaranj had reportedly been captured with almost no resistance, Afghan journalist Bilal Sarwary voiced suspicions that someone had sold the city to the Taliban. A UN envoy also warned the country was entering a \\\\deadlier phase\\\\ of the war. The British government warned its citizens to leave Afghanistan immediately amid the Taliban advance and the worsening security situation\\\\c\\\\cOn 7 August, the Taliban had captured Sheberghan, making it the second capture of a provincial capital. Abdul Rashid Dostum, the ex-warlord and the strongman who had traditionally dominated the city, took his followers and fled to Khwaja Du Koh District, the only area in Jowzjan Province which was still government-held. Meanwhile, pro-government forces had been reduced to a pocket of resistance in Lashkar Gah, while Kandahar and Herat remained fiercely contested. Insurgents also launched repeated raids on the other provincial capitals. The following day, the Taliban overran most of Kunduz and Sar-e Pol city after heavy clashes with the Afghan National Security Forces.

Diplomatic relations between the Soviet Union and Egypt were established on August 26, 1943. Egypt has an embassy in Moscow, while Russia has an embassy in Cairo and a consulate-general in Alexandria\\\\c\\\\cRelations between Russia and Egypt have a long history, dating back to before the 16th century.  Early on, they were centered on the Russian government\\\\s and the Russian Church\\\\s support for the Greek Orthodox Church of Alexandria.  As early as in 1556, Patriarch Joachim of Alexandria sent a letter to the Russian Tzar Ivan IV,  asking the Orthodox monarch to provide some material assistance for the Saint Catherine\\\\s Monastery in the Sinai Peninsula, which had suffered from the Turks. In 1558, the Czar sent to Egypt a delegation led by archdeacon Gennady, who, however, died in Constantinople before he could reach Egypt. From then on, the embassy was headed by a Smolensk merchant, Vasily Poznyakov. Poznyakov\\\\s delegation visited Alexandria, Cairo, and Sinai, brought the patriarch a fur coat and an icon sent by the Tzar. Poznyakov\\\\s  account of its two and half years\\\\ travels, which may have  been the first ever Russian first-hand African trip report,  became popular among Russian readers for centuries to follow\\\\c\\\\cRussia continued to provide support to Egyptian Christians for centuries to come\\\\c\\\\cIn the 1950s, Gamal Abdel Nasser\\\\s independent and anti-imperialist policy earned him enthusiastic support from the Communist government of the USSR. In 1955, Egypt  made a major arms deal with Soviet Union, and from then, teams of Egyptian officers were trained in Eastern Bloc countries. Czechoslovak instructors also came in 1956, to train Egyptian personnel in the use of Soviet weapons. When France attacked Egypt during Suez Crisis, USSR threatened to use destructive weapons i.e. nuclear weapons for the defense of Egypt.  The degree of the Soviet approval of the Egyptian leader\\\\s policies culminated, rather controversially, in the award of the highest Soviet decoration, the star of the Hero of the Soviet Union with the Order of Lenin  to Nasser during Nikita Khrushchev\\\\s visit to the country in 1964\\\\c\\\\cDuring the Nasser years, many young Egyptians studied in Soviet universities and military schools. Among them was the future president, Hosni Mubarak, who went for training in a military pilot school in Kyrgyzstan. During the War of Attrition, USSR sent 10-15000 servicemen to operate the air defense of Egypt against Israeli air attacks\\\\c\\\\cThe relationship went sour within years after the death of Nasser, when the new president, Anwar Sadat, started re-orienting the country toward the West. On May 27, 1971, a friendship treaty was signed between the two countries, but relations were nevertheless declining. In July 1972, it was claimed the Egyptian government expelled Soviet military advisors from Egypt, (however new research indicates that this was disinformation to hide Egypt\\\\s offensive plans), and captured Egyptian documents demonstrate that Soviet advisors continued in their previous roles of training Egyptian troops, and were certainly present during the war in 1973. During the Yom Kippur War , Soviet Union sent several thousands of tonnes of aid to Egypt. Brezhnev threatened to intervene on behalf of Egypt if Israel broke the ceasefire. Lieutenant General Anatoly Pushkin claimed that 1500 Soviet pilots and air defense experts engaged in combat for Egypt during the war. In March 1976 Egypt abrogated the friendship treaty, and relations between the two countries were damaged once again when Egypt supported the Mujahadeen in Afghanistan when the USSR invaded in 1979. In September 1981, these relations were severed by the Egyptian government, accusing Soviet leadership of trying to undermine Sadat\\\\s leadership in retaliation to the Israeli-Egyptian peace treaty. Relations were reestablished under president Hosni Mubarak in 1984, and Alexander Belonogov became the Ambassador. In February 1989, Soviet Minister of Foreign Affairs Eduard Shevardnadze visited Egypt\\\\c\\\\cIntergovernmental relations improved after the fall of Communism in the USSR, and Russia\\\\s appearance as an independent political actor\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2005, the Russian President, Vladimir Putin, visited Egypt, and Egyptian President Hosni Mubarak visited Russia in April 2008. Both countries agreed to work together to help Egypt create a nuclear program which is mostly for civilian purposes. In May 2013, Egyptian President Mohamed Morsi visited Russia\\\\c\\\\cRelations between the two countries improved even further following the removal of Mohamed Morsi from office in July 2013. Both countries have since then worked closely to strengthen military and trade ties, among other aspects of bilateral cooperation. From 2009 to 2018, Russia accounted for 31% of Egypt\\\\s imports of major weapons\\\\c\\\\cIn November 2013, Egypt\\\\s then Defense Minister Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Foreign Minister Nabil Fahmy met with their Russian counterparts, Defense Minister Sergei Shoigu and Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov who were on a visit to Cairo. Fahmy stated that Egypt wished to return to Soviet-level relations with Russia, and Shoigu hinted that there may be military cooperation between the Russian and Egyptian navies and air forces.[citation needed] It was the first meeting of its kind since the Soviet era\\\\c\\\\cSince then, Egyptian and Russian leaders have exchanged two rounds of four-way visits in both Cairo and Moscow. Sisi went to Russia twice in 2014: in February, when he was still Egypt\\\\s defense minister, and in August after his election as president. The February meeting was Sisi\\\\s first visit abroad following Mohamed Morsi\\\\s removal, during which Russian president Vladimir Putin offered him Russia\\\\s backing in his race for the presidency of Egypt before Sisi even officially announced his campaign\\\\c\\\\cSisi made his second visit on August 12 at the Black Sea resort of Sochi, and it was his first to a non-Arab or African country since his inauguration as President two months earlier. During the visit, both him and Putin agreed on boosting bilateral cooperation between the two countries. Putin promised to speed up arms sales to Egypt. We are actively developing our military and technological cooperation, Putin told Sisi. He added that a corresponding protocol was signed in March and that weapons are being delivered to Egypt\\\\c\\\\cTrade and economic investment plans were also announced during the meeting, during which Putin said that Egypt was discussing a free trade zone with the Russian-led Eurasian Customs Union which also includes Belarus and Kazakhstan.[citation needed] Additionally, both leaders have discussed plans to establish a Russian industrial zone in the New Suez Canal project that was recently inaugurated by Sisi, as well as another plan to renew and redevelop important projects that were established by the former Soviet Union\\\\c\\\\cIn September 2014, a preliminary deal was reached between both countries to buy arms worth $3.5 billion from Russia, despite Western sanctions on Moscow as a result of its involvement in the war in Donbass\\\\c\\\\cAs a result of the Metrojet Flight 9268 crash on October 31, 2015, which carried 224 passengers on board toward Russia, both countries were planning investigating the crash\\\\c\\\\cOn November 28, 2015, Egypt and Russia signed a deal which would allow Russian and Egyptian warplanes to use each other\\\\s airbases and airspace. Both countries could be described as close allies as Putin usually referred to Sisi as a Trusted and Close Partner. On 11 December 2017, during President Vladimir Putin\\\\s visit to Cairo, the two countries signed agreements in which Russia would build Egypt\\\\s first nuclear reactor, and supply nuclear fuel for the same. It was also agreed that a Russian Industrial Zone would be built along the Suez Canal, explained by Putin as being the biggest regional center for producing Russian products onto the markets of the Middle-East and North Africa\\\\c\\\\cRussia supports Syrian government in the Syrian civil war, and intervened militarily in its favor in 2015. Egypt also supports the Syrian government in the Civil War. In 2020, Egypt has reportedly dispatched 150 troops to help Syrian government. Egypt is openly backing House of Representatives in the ongoing Libyan Civil War, while the Russian mercenary organization Wagner Group is assisting the House of Representatives\\\\ forces\\\\c\\\\cIn summer 2020, Egypt received five Su-35 jets, despite the American threatening with sanctions. However, the Russian journalist, Ivan Safronov, who revealed the transaction was detained for disclosing a state secret\\\\c\\\\cRussians constitute the largest group of outsiders to visit Egypt, while Russia is popular with Egyptian tourists as well.[citation needed] As of 2015[update] Egypt is the most popular tourist destination for Russians traveling abroadâa basic vacation package including flight, hotel and meals can be purchased for as little as US$1,000\\\\c\\\\cIn 2006, the Egyptian Russian University was opened in Badr City, Cairo, offering training in pharmacy and engineering\\\\c\\\\cMany of its students visit Izhevsk, Russia, for additional classroom study and summer internships.

The Arkansas chapter of the American Academy of Pediatrics released a statement that indicated it could not support a return to statewide in-person instruction in Arkansas public schools during the month of August. The Little Rock Education Association requested that the school year start with at least two weeks of online education.

This season began nearly five months before the official start, with Hurricane Alex forming in the Northeastern Atlantic in mid-January. Tropical Storm Bonnie followed in late May, which was the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012. In June, tropical storms Colin and Danielle formed and became the earliest third and fourth named storms in the Atlantic in recorded history. In August, Hurricane Earl killed 67 people after striking Belize and Mexico..\\\\c\\\\cTo this point, most forecasting groups have expected this season to be an above average season, due to a combination of factors including an expected transition to La NinÌa and warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Western Atlantic, despite near-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Main Development Region near Cape Verde. So far, six of the eight developed storms have impacted land, and 5 of those storms caused loss of life, directly or indirectly..\\\\c\\\\cAhead of and during the season, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Colorado State University (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014â16 El NinÌo event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, two major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 66â103 units..\\\\c\\\\cThe first forecast for the year was issued by CSU on December 10, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. TSR subsequently issued their first outlook for the 2016 season during December 16, 2015 and predicted that activity would be about 20% below the 1950â2015 average, or about 15% below the 2005â2015 average. Specifically they thought that there would be 13 tropical storms, 5 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes and an ACE index of 79 units. A few months later, TSR issued their second prediction for the season during April 6, 2016 and lowered the predicted number of named storms to 12 but raised the number of hurricanes to 6.  On April 14, CSU predicted that the season would be near-normal, predicting 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes with ACE near 93. On April 15, North Carolina State University predicted the season would be very active, with 15-18 named storms, 8-11 hurricanes and 3-5 major hurricanes. A month later, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) released its forecast, predicting a slightly above-average season with 14 named storms and 8 hurricanes. It also predicted  an ACE index of 125, above the defined average ACE index at 103. On May 27, NOAA issued its first outlook calling for a near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10-16 named storms could form, including 4-8 hurricanes of which 1-4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated that there is a 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La NinÌa forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal..\\\\c\\\\cCSU updated their forecast on June 1 to include 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include recently formed Tropical Storm Bonnie. It was again updated on July 1 to include 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, to accommodate for tropical storms Colin and Danielle. On July 5, TSR released their fourth forecast for the season, slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. On August 5, TSR released their final forecast for the season, lowering the numbers to 15 named storms and 7 hurricanes due to the influence that La NinÌa being less than anticipated previously..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 13, an extratropical cyclone over the eastern Atlantic Ocean developed into a subtropical storm. Assigned the name Alex, the system soon developed into a fully tropical hurricaneâthe first such storm in January since Alice in 1955. Alex then made landfall over Terceira Island, Azores, as a strong tropical storm, before becoming extratropical on January 15. The next tropical cyclone developed in late May, originating as a tropical depression on May 27. The next day, the depression developed into Tropical Storm Bonnie, the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012 and the third occurrence since 1951. Bonnie drifted north-northwestwards over the following day, before weakening back into a depression early on May 29, however its remnant low regenerated into a tropical storm a few days later and finally dissipated north of Bermuda on June 5. Simultaneously, a new tropical depression developed near the YucataÌn Peninsula. This depression soon became Tropical Storm Colin on June 5, marking the earliest occurrence of a seasons third named storm since reliable records began, surpassing the previous record set in 1887. On June 20, when Danielle had strengthened into a tropical storm, it also marked the earliest fourth named storm, surpassing the previous record set by Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 by 3 days. However, after Danielle, activity halted as no storms formed in July, an occurrence not seen since 2012. Activity resumed once again with the formation of Hurricane Earl, Tropical Storm Fiona, Hurricane Gaston, and Tropical Depression Eight in the month of August..\\\\c\\\\cThe Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, as of 09:00 UTC on August 28, is 18.9925 units..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 7, the National Hurricane Center noted the potential for an extratropical low about 425 mi (685 km) west-southwest of Bermuda to gain subtropical or tropical characteristics over subsequent days, as it tracked across the central Atlantic. Convection began to coalesce near the center of the low on January 13, leading to the formation of Subtropical Storm Alex about 785 miles (1,260 km) south-southwest of the Azores, at 21:00 UTC. Alex is the first tropical or subtropical storm to form in January since 1978, and only the fourth known tropical or subtropical cyclone formation during the month on record. When Alex became a hurricane at 15:00 UTC on January 14, it marked only the second recorded hurricane formation in January, with the other being Hurricane One in 1938. On January 15, the NHC issued its last advisory on Hurricane Alex, as the system transitioned back into an extratropical cyclone. On January 17, Alex was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone, in the southern Labrador Sea..\\\\c\\\\cOn May 24, the NHC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather resultant from the interaction of a weakening cold front and an upper-level trough. A surface area of low pressure formed late the next day, eventually gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on May 27. Steered west-northwest within an only marginally conducive environment, the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie a day later. The continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclones appearance to degenerate early on May 29, and Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength less than an hour prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina. The depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before regressing to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 15:00 UTC on May 30. However, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression on June 2 amidst more favorable conditions. Late the next day, Bonnie re-strengthened back to a tropical storm due to a burst of convection. Bonnie then weakened to a tropical depression on June 4 and then early on June 5, Bonnie finally dissipated into a remnant low..\\\\c\\\\cUpon formation, a tropical storm warning was hoisted in South Carolina from the Savannah River to the Little River Inlet. Heavy rains associated with Bonnie led to localized flooding, prompting the South Carolina Highway Patrol to close the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Jasper County, South Carolina. Rip currents along the coastline of the Southeast United States led to dozens of water rescues; the body of one 20-year-old man was recovered in Brevard County, Florida, after he drowned, while the body of a 21-year-old man was recovered in New Hanover County, North Carolina, several days after he went missing. In all, Bonnie is estimated to have caused more than $640,000 (2016 USD) in structural damage..\\\\c\\\\cIn early June, a low pressure system entered the Caribbean Sea. The low remained disorganized with only isolated convection, mostly in the eastern quadrant. Convection began to wrap into the center as the storm curved northward into the Gulf of Mexico on June 3. After the low passed over the YucataÌn Peninsula on June 5, the National Hurricane Center upgraded it to Tropical Depression Three and tropical storm warnings were issued for the Big Bend region of Florida. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Colin, just after tropical storm watches were put in place for eastern Florida and Georgia. The formation into a tropical storm marked the earliest formation on record of the third named storm within the Atlantic basin, exceeding the previous record set in 1887 by seven days. Gradually curving northeastwards, Colin remained disorganized as it accelerated towards the coast of Florida on June 6; in their forecast discussion, the NHC noted that their uncertainty in locating the circulation center, instead taking the midpoint between two small-scale circulations. However, a strong burst of convection increased the winds to 50 mph (85 km/h). Maintaining its intensity, Colin continued accelerating to the northeast and made landfall in the Big Bend Region just after 03:00 UTC on June 7. Failing to weaken over land, Colin began undergoing extratropical transition after the increasingly ill-defined circulation moved off the coast of Georgia, and became fully extratropical hours later. It remained extratropical and intact for nearly a week before merging with another extratropical cyclone on June 14..\\\\c\\\\cMuch of Florida experienced heavy rainfall, and flash flood and tornado warnings were issued. At least three people drowned along the Florida Panhandle due to rip currents, and a fourth remains missing but is presumed dead. Damage from Colin in the Tampa Bay area totaled $10,000 (2016 USD)..\\\\c\\\\cOn June 14, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave located in the western Caribbean Sea. Tracking steadily to the west-northwest, the disturbance slowly moved over the YucataÌn Peninsula; during that time, development was not expected due to land interaction. However, on June 18, the disturbance exited land and moved over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, upon which it spawned a low pressure area with a well-defined circulation center. A further increase in organization occurred the next day despite strong wind shear, prompting the NHC to upgrade the low to Tropical Depression Four. Concurrently, the Government of Mexico issued tropical storm warnings for part of the state of Veracruz. The depression continued to slowly organize, and after a reconnaissance aircraft measured gale-force winds on June 20, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Danielle. This marked the earliest formation on record of the fourth named storm within the Atlantic basin, preceding the previous record set by Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 by 3 days. Hours later, Danielle reached peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Maintaining strength, Danielle made landfall north of Tuxpan just before June 21. Rapid weakening followed and Danielle dissipated by noon that same day..\\\\c\\\\cAcross much of Veracruz, officials suspended school activities and the Port of Veracruz was temporarily closed. Flooding in the Pueblo Viejo Municipality affected 1,200 families and prompted activation of public shelters. In Ciudad Madero, Tamaulipas, a homeless man drowned in a storm drain during a flash flood..\\\\c\\\\cThe NHC began monitoring a tropical wave in the central Atlantic on July 28. The disturbances rapid movement prevented development for several days until it passed Jamaica on August 2, when a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the presence of a closed circulation; already possessing tropical storm-force winds, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl. Steered generally westward by a ridge over the South United States, Earl intensified amid warm ocean temperatures and low shear, attaining hurricane intensity and peaking with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on August 3. Earl made landfall just southwest of Belize City, Belize around 06:00 UTC on August 4. It quickly weakened over land, although it emerged over the southern Bay of Campeche the following day while still maintaining minimal tropical storm intensity. A Hurricane Hunters mission flew into Earl later on August 5, unexpectedly measuring 60 mph (95 km/h) winds. The cyclone maintained these winds up to landfall just south of Veracruz, Veracruz around 02:00 on August 6. Once inland, Earl quickly weakened and the storms circulation dissipated by 15:00 UTC..\\\\c\\\\cThe precursor to Earl brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles and Greater Antilles. Strong winds in the Dominican Republic downed a power line onto a bus, subsequently causing a fire that killed six people. A boat crash in SamanaÌ Bay killed seven people. Significant impacts were reported in Belize after Earl moved ashore as a hurricane, including downed trees and power lines, blown transformers, damaged or ripped-off roofs, coastal and inland flooding, and a significant storm surge. Landslides in Mexico following the storms second landfall resulted in an additional 54 deaths..\\\\c\\\\cLate on August 14, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection off the western coast of Africa for potential development. Steered west-northwest and eventually northwest, the wave organized amid favorable atmospheric conditions, gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 03:00 UTC on August 17.[citation needed] Later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fiona. Only modest strengthening occurred during the next four days, resulting in a low peak intensity, with one-minute sustained winds of 50 mph. By August 22, Fiona had weakened back into a depression south-southeast of Bermuda. Fiona managed to move slowly to the northwest with irregular pulses of thunderstorms flaring up, but southeast of the low-level center. Eventually, increasing wind shear took its toll on the storm and it was declared a remnant low by the NHC on August 23. The remnant low then dissipated soon thereafter.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cOn August 18, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a strong tropical wave that was about to move off the coast of Africa. It moved off the coast by August 20, with conditions becoming increasingly favorable for development. The low eventually was able to attain a closed circulation west of Cape Verde on August 22, and was declared Tropical Depression Seven shortly thereafter. It then strengthened into a tropical storm by August 23 and was named Gaston. On August 24, during a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm, they found that Gaston had hurricane-force winds, so they declared it a hurricane at 12:15 AM AST. No further strengthening occurred as wind shear associated with a nearby stationary front and dry air weakened Gaston into a tropical storm only twelve hours later. Weakening continued, with Gastons winds lowering to 60 mph later that day. Through the evening hours, convection reorganized, allowing Gaston to restrengthen.[citation needed] On August 27, Gaston restrengthened back into a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 85 mph. The next day, the storm intensified into a 90 mph Category 1 hurricane, and then on 15:00 UTC a Category 2 hurricane with maximum winds of 100 mph. On 21:00 UTC, Gaston was designated as a Category 3 hurricane, the first of the season..\\\\c\\\\cAs of 5:00 p.m. AST (21:00 UTC) August 28, Hurricane Gaston is located within 20 nautical miles of 30Â°48â²N 55Â°06â²W\\\\ufeff / \\\\ufeff30.8Â°N 55.1Â°W\\\\ufeff / 30.8; -55.1\\\\ufeff (Gaston), about 580 miles (935 km) east of Bermuda.

The minimum barometric pressure is 962 mbar (hPa; 28.41 inHg), and the system is moving northwest at 4 knots (5 mph; 7 km/h). Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center of Gaston..\\\\c\\\\cFor latest official information, see:.\\\\c\\\\cAs of 11:00 a.m. AST (15:00 UTC) August 28, Tropical Depression Eight is located near 31Â°30â²N 70Â°00â²W\\\\ufeff / \\\\ufeff31.5Â°N 70.0Â°W\\\\ufeff / 31.5; -70.0\\\\ufeff (Eight), about 310 miles (500 km) west of Bermuda, or about 405 miles (655 km/h) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

Retired names, if any, will be announced by the World Meteorological Organization in the spring of 2017. The names not retired from this list will be used again in the 2022 season. This is the same list used in the 2010 season, with the exception of Ian and Tobias, which replaced Igor and Tomas, respectively..\\\\c\\\\cThis is a table of all the storms that have formed in the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season. It includes their duration, names, landfall(s), denoted in parentheses, damages, and death totals. Deaths in parentheses are additional and indirect (an example of an indirect death would be a traffic accident), but were still related to that storm. Damage and deaths include totals while the storm was extratropical, a wave, or a low, and all the damage figures are in 2016 USD..\\\\c\\\\cAdditional information on this system can be found in High Seas Forecasts issued by the National Weather Service, under AWIPS header NFDHSFAT1, WMO header FZNT01 KWBC, and online at ocean.weather.gov/shtml/NFDHSFAT1.php $$ Forecaster Zelinsky\\n',\n"," 'The impeachment process against Dilma Rousseff, the President of Brazil, began in late 2015 and continued through 2016. An impeachment request against Rousseff was accepted by Eduardo Cunha, then president of the Chamber of Deputies, on 2 December 2015. Rousseff has been charged for responsibility crimes in the execution of her duties, including administrative misconduct and disregarding the federal budget, in violation of article 85, items V and VI of the Brazilian Constitution and the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law], article 36. However, a large number of scholars and witnesses during the hearing phase of the process, stating it is not related to responsibility crimes. In course of the process, two of the six supplemental budget decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress, were considered neutral from the fiscal perspective and removed of the charges..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to the impeachment request, Rousseff was also accused of omission concerning irregularities in Petrobras that, facing serious facts investigated by Operation Car Wash while occupying the office of president of Brazil, failed to fend off the suspects. Also according to the report, the fact is aggravated by Rousseff having been president of the board of directors in the Brazilian oil company, when the investigated facts occurred, including the controversial acquisition of Pasadena Refining System, cited on page 3 of the impeachment request. According to this request, her omission would indicate criminal responsibility.  However, these charges of omission were not included in the process, since a request indicting the involvement of Rousseff in the suspicious purchase of Pasadena had archived, by the lawful impediment to investigate the President for previous act to its mandate.On August 31st of 2016, President Rousseff was removed from office by a vote of 61-20..\\\\c\\\\cAlleged graft occurred while President Rousseff was still part of the board of directors of state-owned energy company Petrobras from 2003 to 2010. One million Brazilians protested in the streets calling for Rousseff\\\\s impeachment. No evidence that Rousseff herself was involved in the scheme has been found and she has denied any prior knowledge of the graft. Further investigation found that there were various offshore accounts and collections of art that were held by those involved in the controversy..\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2014, an investigation by Brazilian Federal Police called Operation Car Wash placed Petrobras at the center of what may be the largest corruption scandal in Brazil\\\\s history. On 14 November 2014, police raids across six Brazilian states netted prominent Brazilian politicians and businessmenâincluding some Petrobras directorsâwho were placed under investigation in regards to suspicious contracts worth $22 billion..\\\\c\\\\cUnder Rousseff, the government of Brazil has also been accused of carrying out fiscal pedaling â an accounting maneuver through which the government gives the false impression that it received more money than was spent. The government failed to provide funds to public and private banks that make payments for a number of public expense programs, including social assistance programs like Bolsa FamiÌlia, forcing the banks to finance programs without receiving government compensation. The government\\\\s apparent motive was to improve its fiscal outcomes for the years 2012 to 2014. The Tribunal de Contas da UniaÌo (TCU), in a unanimous decision, considered this operation a violation of fiscal responsibility. TCU is an auxiliary of the legislative body and has no legal power; however their decision put the National Congress under pressure to begin the process of impeachment of President Rousseff..\\\\c\\\\cRousseff was reelected in the 2014 general election, winning 51.64% of the votes. The election was one of the most contentious presidential elections in the country\\\\s history. After being sworn in on the 1st of January 2015, she started her second term weakened, mainly due to the national recession that started in 2014 and allegations of corruption, which led to a 9% approval rating in a survey by Ibope held in July of that yearâthe lowest approval rating ever for the president. On 15 March 2015, several protests began, gathering hundreds of thousands of Brazilians across the country to demand the impeachment or the resignation of Rousseff, among other issues..\\\\c\\\\cBeyond the violations of the budget law, Rousseff and her government were increasingly tainted by corruption allegations. The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Cunha, was investigated in Operation Car Wash, under allegations of receiving bribes and keeping secret Swiss bank accounts. Consequently, Cunha was in danger of losing his mandate as the Ethics Council of the Chamber moved a lawsuit against him. Rumors emerged about attempts to agreement between the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and the Workers\\\\ Party (PT), in order to end this process, which he strongly denied. When the Workers\\\\ Party announced its support for the wedge term loss on the Board of Ethics, he would have accepted the request for impeachment as an instrument of blackmail..\\\\c\\\\cIn his defense, Cunha said The receipt of the complaint has clearly defined reasons, when it talks about direct participation in the conduct described in what were then budget decrees. I haven\\\\t issued and I will not issue any judgment on the accusation against the President of the Republic, even more if it\\\\s a personal matter. I\\\\m just sticking to facts typified (in the law). He also stressed that Rousseff signed six decrees with additional credits, which increased the 2015 federal spending in non-compliance with the annual budget law and without approval of the Congress..\\\\c\\\\cInconsistent and unfounded are the reasons for this request. There is no illegal act committed by me [...] I would never accept any kind of bargain, much less those that threaten the free functioning of democratic institutions in this country..\\\\c\\\\cIn turn, Rousseff denied any attempt to forge a deal to save Cunha and get rid of impeachment, as well as agreements to interfere with the Ethics Board in exchange for the approval of a pt [CPMF] (Provisional Contribution on the Movement or Transmission of Values and Credits and Financial Nature Rights), which was another great need of the government. At a news conference on 2 December, she said that she never would accept or agree with any kind of bargain..\\\\c\\\\cShe lied on national television network and this is very serious. If she had not participated directly I would not speak..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the pronouncement of the president, Cunha said Rousseff lied to the nation when she said she would not participate in any bargain and that the government had much to explain to the country. Cunha claimed he was not aware of negotiations and that he had not met Jaques Wagner (the supposed intermediary in negotiations with Rousseff). Declaring himself against the Workers\\\\ Party, he said he would rather not have the three votes from the party in the Council of Ethics..\\\\c\\\\cPolitical scientists heard by AgeÌncia Brasil on December 2015, commented on the political crisis. They stated that Rousseff\\\\s inability to negotiate with Congress, in addition to the political system, which allows the fragmenting and great number of political parties in Brazil, caused a loss of governability. Moreover, the opposition confronted Rousseff since elections on 2014, refuting the electoral results and calling for a recount of votes. Her campaign accounts was also disputed and the impeachment threat has destabilized the government. However, the outbreak of the process could be beneficial for Rousseff, who would be free from blackmail and could potentially reorganize her government. Political scientists believed Cunha could lose his mandate and that the opposition would try to push the process in Congress for 2016 in order to mitigate the electoral ecstasy and act of revenge that was the host of the application..\\\\c\\\\cIn CNT/MDA polls performed in March 2015, only 10.8% of Brazilians approved of Rouseff\\\\s government and 59.7% wanted her impeached. In July 2015, this number had risen to 62.8%. By April 2016, in polls performed by Datafolha Institute, 61% of Brazilians believed that Rousseff should have been impeached..\\\\c\\\\cSince 2012, a total of 37 requests for impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff have been presented to the Chamber of Deputies. However, only one request was accepted by then president of the Chamber Eduardo Cunha. The accepted request for impeachment was submitted by former congressman and attorney pt [HeÌlio Bicudo] and attorneys pt [Miguel Reale JuÌnior] and pt [Janaina Paschoal]. The request was based on allegations of omission concerning irregularities in Petrobras, fiscal responsibility crimes, and budgetary mismanagement..\\\\c\\\\cIn the course of Operation Car Wash, many illegal and suspicious operations were investigated, including the purchase of the Pasadena Refinery by Petrobras, a business that has proved extremely unfavourable to Brazil, according to the impeachment request. The financial losses were higher than R$700 million (US$320 million). Roussef was president of the Board of Directors of Petrobras and gave as excuse, a mistake concerning a contractual clause. According to the report, the President insisted in thesis that the allegations would be a kind of coup, mere attempt to weaken Petrobras, always emphasizing its expertise in economy and energy sector, namely, the President insisted on the company\\\\s financial health. She stepped down in Petrobras only in February 2015, when the situation was already untenable..\\\\c\\\\cThe report also denounces a corrupt scheme involving shady deals of former President Lula, who intermediated business of the Brazilian construction company Norberto Odebrecht in Cuba and Angola, which Rousseff had knowledge that were for the purpose of money laundering of corruption at Petrobras. Some international companies were chosen to be encouraged and, thereafter, participating in unrealistic bids, drain the state-owned company, giving back much of the values through seemingly licit donations. In statements taken from accused in Operation Car Wash, was found that Lula and Dilma knew of the bribery scheme in Petrobras..\\\\c\\\\cRousseff has edit in the years 2014 and 2015, six unnumbered decrees that resulted in the provision of additional credits to social programs with electoral purposes, without authorization from Congress. These values were in the amount of R$18.5 billion (US$6.9 billion) and were contracted in official financial institutions without the necessary legislative authorization, even with the targets set not being complied in the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law] and the pt [Annual Budgetary Law]. To obtain these additional credits, the target of 2014 was reduced by the end of 2014 by R$67 billion (US$25 billion), at the request of the president. The same conduct of the accused was committed in 2015. Rousseff, by means of decrees, authorized in the years 2014 and 2015, the opening credit, disregarding the Annual Budgetary Law and the Federal Constitution, precisely to allow the provision of additional resources when it was known that the primary superavit target in the Budget forecast was not being fulfilled, and would not be fulfilled..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2011 and 2014, the Union has held illegal credit operations from no transfer of funds to the national financial system entities controlled by the State. That practice was taken from financial advances made by official financial institutions, such as Caixa EconoÌmica Federal and Banco do Brasil for finance social programs of responsibility of the Federal Government. These transactions were reported in 2015 by Tribunal de Contas da UniaÌo and, according to the report, aimed at election results..\\\\c\\\\cThe Union contracted Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil as operators by Federal Government social programs. For this purpose, the Union should pass along directly from the pt [National Treasury Secretary] account, the necessary resources for the realization of programs each month, more precisely, would be obliged to transfer to the financial institutions the equivalent values for the equalization of interest rates, expenditures and legal transfers. But the government has not done these refunds and the contracted financial system entities made payments to programs beneficiaries with own resources and hence promoted the credit constitution in his favor against the Union. This procedure is a form of mutual credit, or similar operation and in accordance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law, art. 36, is prohibited to carry out credit operations between a state financial institution and the member of the Federation that controls it, as the borrower. The total balance of these liabilities by the end of August 2014 was R$1.74 billion (US$740 million). Of an amount of R$7.8 billion (US$2.9 billion) spent on subsidies in the programs between 2009 and 2014, only R$1.6 billion (US$590 million) was transferred by the Union..\\\\c\\\\cBy the end of 2014, Rousseff sent to the National Congress the PLN Nr. 362014, to change the pt [Budgetary Directives Law] aimed at modifying the rules of the primary superavit. Thus, has demonstrated knowledge of the results of the public accounts and which has taken the necessary steps to regularize them. However, he did just to meet your interest, as sought avoid being accused of a crime committed for not meet the fiscal targets set out in law..\\\\c\\\\cBoth the Federal Constitution and Article 4 of Law 1079/50, establish that give rise the impediment of the President the fact that attempt against probity in administration and against the budget law. Are crimes of responsibility against the budget law, order or authorize the opening of credit in disagreement with the limits set by the Senate, not well-founded in budget law or in additional credit law or inobservance of legal prescription;(Law Nr. 10028, 2000) and fail to promote or to order the full settlement of credit operations in anticipation of budget revenue, including related interest and other charges, until the end of the fiscal period; (Law Nr. 10028, 2000)..\\\\c\\\\cTherefore, there is a political violation, which may lead to the impeachment, by Legislative trial, and there is a civil offense, which entails indemnities and mandate cassation by the Judiciary. When the author of conduct is the President, also commit crime of responsibility, pursuant to art. 10 of Law n. 1079/50, amended by Law Nr. 10028/2000..\\\\c\\\\cThere were 37 requests for impeachment filed with the Chamber of Deputies by September 2015, against Dilma Rousseff, but the president\\\\s home only received the written request of pt [HeÌlio Bicudo] and the lawyers pt [Miguel Reale JuÌnior] and pt [Janaina Paschoal]. The social movement pro-impeachment (such as the Free Brazil Movement and pt [Come to the Street Movement]) decided to join Bicudo\\\\s request. It also had the support of parliamentarians and civil society, which organized a petition in support of the impeachment of the President of the Republic..\\\\c\\\\cLawyers, in the document presented to the House, tried to associate Dilma Rousseff with Operation Car Wash, cited failure in case of corruption, investigated influence peddling against former President Luiz InaÌcio Lula da Silva and fiscal pedaling. In addition, it contributed to support the request of six decrees signed by the president in the fiscal year of 2015 in disagreement with the law guidelining the budget, which were published without permission of the Congress..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the acceptance of the request, a special committee was formed in the Chamber of Deputies to decide on its admissibility. It began with the testimony of the authors of the request, followed by a presentation of Rousseff\\\\s defense. Meanwhile, street protests for and against the impeachment occurred periodically throughout the country. The committee\\\\s report was favorable to impeaching the President: 38 deputies approved the report while 27 did not..\\\\c\\\\cOn 17 April 2016, the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the Brazilian Parliament) concluded a general vote for the admission of the impeachment process. 367 members voted for impeachment, while 137 voted against, 7 abstained and 2 were absent from the session. The internal rules of the house stated that the process would be admitted only if it received at least 342 votes for, between the 513 sitting members. On the following day, the president of the Chamber, Eduardo Cunha, delivered the process to the Senate, upper legislative house, which follow the procedure and judged the case. On 5 May 2016, Teori Zavascki, judge of Supreme Federal Court decided that Eduardo Cunha must to step down from the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies and suspend his mandate, because he is facing a corruption trial. The decision was later endorsed by all eleven judges of Court and has not affected the process of impeachment against Dilma Rousseff..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the vote held in the Chamber on 17 April to allow the charges against the President to be presented to the Senate, the process was delivered by Cunha to the Senate and confirmed with a 55â22 vote on 12 May, in a section that lasted more than 20 hours, resulting in the suspension of Rousseff\\\\s presidential powers and duties up to 180 days. During this period, while the judgment of the process occurs (which decides whether the president should be convicted and removed from office, or acquitted with powers and duties restored), Rousseff\\\\s vice-president Michel Temer will serve as acting president..\\\\c\\\\cIn the Brazilian political system, the President and Vice President form a single electoral coalition. However, their terms are constitutionally separate. Michel Temer was President of the Chamber of Deputies during the Fernando Henrique Cardoso presidential mandate, from 1995 to 2002. Temer is a member of PMDB, which declared moving to opposition to Dilma Rousseff government on March 2016. According to some newspapers such as The Guardian, for those desperate for change, Temer represents salvation. Others, more concerned about the countryâs fragile democracy, believe he is the perpetrator of a coup. A separate proposal to impeach Michael Temer as Acting President and Vice President has been made..\\\\c\\\\cA CNT/MDA poll published on 8 June 2016, indicates that 11.3% of Brazilians approved and 28% censured the acting government of President Temer. For 30.2% of respondents, Temer\\\\s government is ordinary, while 30.5% not answered. The survey revealed that 46.6% of Brazilians believed that the corruption in government Temer could be equal to that experienced in government Rousseff. Also according to the poll, 28.3% believe that corruption could be lessen, while 18.6% estimated that it could be even greaten. Regarding to lawfulness in the process of impeachment, 61.5% agreeded with the conduction of the process, 33.3% answered negatively and 5.2% not answered. According to the survey agency, the CNT/MDA heard 2,002 people in 137 municipalities in 25 federative units from 2 to 5 June. The margin of error was 2.2 percentage points, with 95% of reliability..\\\\c\\\\cA poll of Ipsos Consulting, by early July 2016, concluded that 16% of Brazilians had preferred Temer definitely in office. For 20%, Rousseff should be acquitted and reconducted to office to conclude her four-year mandate. 52% answered that both, Temer or Roussef, whoever that assume the command of the nation, must call new elections for president. However, anticipate elections can only occur with the approval of a large majority of Congress (three-fifths) or Temer and Rousseff resign simultaneously, that would be unlikely. Otherwise, both could be removed from their offices, depending on the outcome of a lawsuit filed in Superior Electoral Court by the PSDB, party of AeÌcio Neves, then defeated candidate in the presidential elections of 2014, claiming that there was electoral crime in the political campaign of the alliance Rousseff-Temer, with donations made by companies investigated in the Operation Car Wash. In the poll, 12% were undecided or not answered. Were heard 1,200 people in 72 Brazilian municipalities. The margin of error was 3 percentage points..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to the pt [National Confederation of Industry], the industry confidence index reached 47.3 points on July 2016, from 45.7 in June, 10.1 points higher than July 2015. According to Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the pt [National Index of Consumer Prices Broad] in Brazil decreased from 0.78% in May 2016 to 0.35% in June 2016, the lowest index since August 2015..\\\\c\\\\cCompleted the phases of appreciation and admissibility of the impeachment process, the subsequent procedure requires new citations, instruction with gathering of evidences and witness testimonies to support the decision. The Senate, in a plenary session, pronounce by a simple majority if the charges are well-founded or not to the decisive judgment. The first task is Rousseff notification to allow a new defence. For this whole second phase of the process, the Committee is supported by the president of Supreme Federal Court, Ricardo Lewandowski. The last phase of the trial, that decided by the conviction or acquittal of the withdrawn President, is chaired by Lewandowski, on the condition of Supreme Court president. On this decisive voting, two-thirds of the votes (54 of the total of 81 senators) are needed to permanently remove the President..\\\\c\\\\c1 June 2016 completed the 20-day period to suspended President Dilma Rousseff formalize a previous defence for the trial in the Senate. The document was personally registered on Senate by Rousseff\\\\s lawyer, former Minister of Justice and former General\\\\s Office attorney JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo..\\\\c\\\\cIn the 370-page document, besides the reasons already claimed on the previous phase, that the president has not committed the alleged crimes of responsibility, it is stated that the just cause or reason aimed at the need for consummation of Rousseff\\\\s impeachment was only and exclusively the aim at end up the Operation Car Wash. For this statement, Cardozo was supported by the transcripts of an occultly recorded conversation among pt [SeÌrgio Machado (politician and businessman)], former president of Transpetro (a Petrobras subsidiary), and the senator Romero JucaÌ, a politician with influential leadership in the Brazilian party PMDB, published by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. In the concept of Cardozo, the dialogue indicated that they were trying to obstruct the investigation sprawling, due to the risk of both be caught up and suggest that Rousseff\\\\s impeachment could have been part of an agreement aiming to prevent and possibly even cease the investigations in the Operation Car Wash. Otherwise, the lawyer of senator JucaÌ said that his client never thought to perform any interference in the Operation Car Wash and the dialogue does not suggest that..\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 May 2016, the senator Antonio Anastasia, rapporteur of the Special Committee of Impeachment 2016 (CEI 2016), presented the work plan for the trial. Workers Party senators complained about the haste to adjudicate. The Committee\\\\s president Raimundo Lira accepted the request and the next meeting was scheduled to 2 June, for analysis of new deadlines..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 June 2016, the Committee has appreciated the report with new work plan deadlines presented by the rapporteur Anastasia and requests by senators. The session, that lasted over nine hours, was attended by Roussef\\\\s lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo. Anastasia has proposed by 7 July the final arguments of the prosecution and the defence. Once, the Worker Party senators disagreed with deadlines and decided that they would presented a new revision of the deadlines for analisys of the president of Court, Ricardo Levandowsy. Anastasia also rejected to append in process, the recording of the conversation among SeÌrgio Machado and the senator Romero JucaÌ, required by Cardozo. In his understanding, it would be irrelevant to the process, since that the charges against Roussef were fiscal responsibility crimes and the recording was only an informal conversation and nothing could proved legally. Cardozo protested against the decision, claiming that the facts cited in the record were a main object of the investigation. The report was voted and approved just at 20h40. Earlier, the Workers Party senators and the attorney Cardozo withdrew from the meeting, after accusing the Committee\\\\s president Lira to lessen the rights of defence. Cardozo has announced on 3 June, that would submit appeals of that decisions to president of Supeme Court, Lewandowski..\\\\c\\\\cOn 6 June, the Committee approved the work plan and deadlines presented by the rapporteur Anastasia..\\\\c\\\\cOn 7 June, Lewandowski denied the appeal filed by Cardozo to append the recording of SeÌrgio Machado, supported by a previous manifestation of the Court, that evidences collected in this kind of testimony are sheltered by confidentiality until the beginning of a formal investigation. SeÌrgio Machado was arrested and introduced the recording of the conversation during his interrogatory. Besides, the subject under appeal had been discussed in prior decisions of the Court. Lewandowski also denied another appeal of senator Aloysio Nunes, former member of the Committee, to reduce the number of witnesses. On 2 June meeting, the Committee established that would be heard eight witnesses for each fact aimed against Rousseff, both for the prosecution and for the defence, i.e. a total of 48 witnesses for each side, with each supplemental budget decree that motivated the request for impeachment, considered separately. Lewandowski held that the Commission\\\\s decision should respect the right to legal defence. Nunes intended that the six decrees were as a unique fact, to be added to the so-called tax pedaling, which should considered another fact, so that the number of witnesses to be heard could be reduced to 16..\\\\c\\\\cThereafter, on 8 June meeting, the Committee accepted a request of both, defence and prosecution, reducing to four the number of supplemental budget decrees to be considered in the trial, as crime of responsibility by President Rousseff. Thus, the number of witnesses in the process was also reduced to forty. Since each charge entitle eight witnesses, the defence of Rousseff could introduce up to 32 witnesses for the four decrees and eight for the tax pedaling charge. The prosecution would be entitled the same number of witnesses. The decision to reduce the charges was supported on a report produced at the course on the House of Representatives, that considered two decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress were neutral from fiscal perspective, once the primary sources and financial expenses listed in these documents were equivalent..\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 June began the witnesses hearings, beginning with the convened by prosecution. Rousseff\\\\s lawyer Jose Eduardo Cardozo and prosecutors JanaiÌna Paschoal and Miguel Reale Junior also attended the meeting. Four witnesses, indicated by the authors of the impeachment request, were heard in the meeting, that lasted over 14 hours, from 11h40 to 2h10 on 9 June: the procurator of the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, the auditor of TCU, Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho, the Credit Operations manager of the pt [National Treasury Secretary], Adriano Pereira de Paula, and the deputy secretary of the National Treasury, Otavio Ladeira de Medeiros..\\\\c\\\\cFraud is the will of, free and consciously, to practice the misconduct and get the result. And that\\\\s what the President did. She edited the decrees by a free and conscious mode to increase costs, that could not increased by a decree. She should sent a bill..\\\\c\\\\cJulio Marcelo de Oliveira said that in April 2015, TCU has identified the recidivist fiscal misconduct, so-called tax pedaling, immediately rejected. There was not previous understanding to modified the rules and the consensus, every time that the TCU has ruled, was disapproved this conduct adopted illegally by Rousseff. He also reiterated that the President acted intentionally to borrow from public banks, that acted coercively in these operations. This, in his opinion, is serious, and forbidden by the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law]. The practice, he said, lasted years, including throughout the year 2015..\\\\c\\\\cThe auditor of TCU, Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho said that the fiscal practices by Rousseff were unprecedented. He also reiterated that the misconducts committed has caused serious outcomes..\\\\c\\\\cOn 9 and 10 June there were no Committee meetings. From 13 to 17 June, there were five meetings, with hearings of sixteen witnesses, two by prosecution and fourteen by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 13 June, were heard the prosecution witnesses Tiago Alves de Gouveia Lins Dutra and Leonardo Rodrigues Albernaz, both TCU auditors. Tiago Dutra said that Rousseff held credit operations with public banks in 2015 that had already observed in 2014. A TCU report pointed a delay of eleven months in the amount of R$2.6 billion, and five months in transfers of R$3 billion, related to the operations. For principal and interest, until December 2015, the government have been paid R$15 billion, of which R$2 billion were related to interest. According Leonardo Albernaz, more than fifty auditors accomplished an analysis of Rousseff accounts and concluded unanimously that her administration has made the most reckless management of public finances since the Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted in May 2000..\\\\c\\\\cThe Committeeâs President, Raimundo Lira, announced the decision of the President of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski, authorizing an audit in the documents, requested by the defence. Lira designated a board consisting of three experts, granting to prosecution, defence and the Senators 48 hours to formulate questions and indicate technical assistants, as well as 24 hours to refute the appointed experts, fixing also a ten days deadline for the completion of audit..\\\\c\\\\cI don\\\\t understand that it was a credit operation, but a rendering of services. At no time that the Union pays to bank was directly related to what the producers has received. The producers received from the bank itself. The Union participation doesn\\\\t characterize a credit operation between the Union and public banks..\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 June, were heard the first witnesses convened by defence, the former National Secretary of Planning and Strategic Investment, Gilson Bittencourt, and the former Secretary of Agricultural Policy of the Ministry of Agriculture, AndreÌ Nassar. Bittencourt said that there was no credit operation between the Union and public banks and also denied that there was delay in the payment of interest to public banks in 2015. According Bittencourt, the debit to be paid in 2016 came to be due only at the time of collection by the banks, that is done every six months. AndreÌ Nassar said that the Bank of Brazil had interest in to circulate money, by lend to producers, even getting the transfers delayed by the government. He also said that, as Secretary of Agricultural Policy and from the point of view of the agricultural sector, this was the most important to avoid a discontinuity that, if had occurred, would generated serious outcomes to the sector..\\\\c\\\\cOn 15 June, were heard three witnesses convened by defence, the former Deputy Secretary of the Federal Budget Office, Cilair Rodrigues de Abreu, the former Secretary of Budget and Administration of the Ministry of Social Security, JoseÌ Geraldo FrancÌ§a Diniz and the Juridical Consultant of the Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management, Walter Baere de ArauÌjo Filho. Cilair Rodrigues said that the understanding of the TCU before 2015 was ever that the future target could be used by Secretary of Budget in the publication of their reports. This understanding has changed, he said, only on 2015. FrancÌ§a Diniz commented that, due the process complexity for supplemental budget decrees, the documents are reviewed by experts and the President could not accomplish a whole analysis of the documents. Rousseff signed, but it would impossible to analyse in details 200 pages of attachments, calculations and spreadsheets. Walter Baere said that the TCU never emitted formal advices concerning the illegality of the issue of supplemental budget decrees by the President. He said also that the TCU has the specific legal duty to alert when there is a possibility of not achieving the fiscal targets..\\\\c\\\\cOn 16 June, were heard four witnesses convened by defence, the former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Education, pt [Luiz ClaÌudio Costa], the former Secretary Executive Assistant of the Ministry of Education, Wagner Vilas Boas, the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Education, Iara Ferreira Pinho and the Director of the Department of Economic Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Clayton Luiz Montes.According to Luiz Claudio Costa, the supplemental budget decree for the Ministry of Education, was important for the management, enabling several sectors linked to the Ministry, such as universities, institutes and others, should adequate their budget to the instant needs. Vilas Boas explained that it was not granting of the Ministry of Education to evaluate the impact of the credit opening for obtaining the primary balance target. He said that the sectorial authority - in this case the agencies of the Ministry - make a request for supplemental budget, but are liable to policy guidance and technical supervision by the budget agency. Both, Wagner Vilas Boas and Iara Pinho, said they could not give an opinion on the compatibility of the signed supplementary decrees and the current fiscal target since their functions donât allow to accomplish analysis of the achievement of the target. Concerning these statements, the prosecution pointed out that the technicians were not able to explain specifically about the possible crime of responsibility. The witnesses left shown that unaware the facts. Our claim is that the evidence shall excusedâ, said prosecution lawyer, Janaina Paschoal, after the testimony of Iara Pinho..\\\\c\\\\cClayton Luiz Montes said that âthe government has followed the new understanding of the TCU by October 2015. Since that time, were not sent any credit decreesâ. This, nevertheless, is conflicting with the statements of TCU auditors, that there was not previous understanding to modified the rules..\\\\c\\\\cOn 17 June, were heard five witnesses convened by defence, the former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management, Nelson Barbosa, the former Minister of Education, pt [JoseÌ Henrique Paim], the Director of the Department of Infrastructure Programs of the Federal Budget Secretary,  Zarak de Oliveira Ferreira, the  Analyst of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management, Antonio JoseÌ Chatack Carmelo, and the Planning and Budget Analyst of the Federal Budget Office, Georgimar Martiniano de Sousa..\\\\c\\\\cNelson Barbosa said that the additional credit decrees issued by President Rousseff from June to August 2015 not prevented the fulfilment of the fiscal target approved by Congress in early 2015 and, since is an supplemental credit that has no impact on the target, was not considered a target of primary balance, but to give more autonomy to the allocation of a value already available. Henrique Paim said that the decrees were essential to the functioning of various sectors of Education, including scientific research and operation of universities. Moreover, according to the former minister, the additional credits are often edited based on revenue generation, provided by budget units, linked to the Ministry. Also the technicians Zarak de Oliveira, Chatack Carmelo and Georgimar Martiniano, have not seen incompatibility of supplemental decrees with the fiscal target..\\\\c\\\\cFrom 20 to 24 June, there were five meetings, with hearings of fifteen witnesses, all convened  by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 June, were heard four witnesses, the former Deputy Chief for Legal Affairs of Staff of the Presidency, Ivo da Motta Azevedo Correa, the former Minister of Education, Renato Janine Ribeiro, the Director of the Department of Social Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Felipe Daruich Neto and the former Deputy Executive Secretary of the Staff of the Presidency, Bruno Moretti. Ivo Correa said that an alert of the TCU is not a decision of the Court, therefore, the government relied on previous jurisprudence to edit the decrees. Janine Ribeiro said that not has received any alert of the TCU about irregularities in the supplemental budget decrees when Minister of Education. Daruich Neto saids that, at any time, as occurred any intentional misconduct and is impracticable to the President evaluate all decrees, before sign it..\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 June, were heard four witnesses, the former Minister of the pt [Secretary of Human Rights], pt [Pepe Vargas], the former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management and former President of Caixa EconoÌmica Federal, pt [Miriam Belchior], the Planning and Budget Analyst and former Deputy Secretary of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Justice, Orlando MagalhaÌes da Cunha and the Coordinator of Budget and Finance of the Ministry of Justice, Marcelo Minghelli. The former Minister Pepe Vargas asserted that the supplemental credit to Secretary of Human Rights was derived not just from Treasury resources, but of surplus resources of funds obtained through donations by individuals and corporations. Mirian Belchior said that the supplemental budget decrees, by which Rousseff is indicted were lawful and was impossible increase the resources contingency as made in 2015..\\\\c\\\\cOn 22 June, were heard three witnesses, the Planning and Budget Analyst and General Coordinator of Technology and Information of the Federal Budget Office, Robson Azevedo Rung, the Secretary of Institutional Organization of the Ministry of Defence, Luiz Antonio de Souza Cordeiro and the Representative of the Superior Labor Court, Luciano Carlos de Almeida. Azevedo Rung said that the Federal Budget Office received a new interpretation from TCU only in 2015, concerning to procedures that ever were well settled..\\\\c\\\\cAlso on this meeting, the Committee approved a new timetable for the trial. On 6 July, testimony of Rousseff, who can be represented by her lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo. From 7 to 12 July, final arguments of the prosecution and from 13 to 27 July, final arguments of the defence. On 9 August, discussion and voting of the report in plenary and 22 August, the estimated date to decisive judgment..\\\\c\\\\cOn 23 June, were heard two witnesses, the  Deputy Secretary of Planning, Budget and Administration of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Anderson Lozi da Rocha and the former Secretary of Federal Budget, Esther Dweck. Dweck denied that the supplemental budget decrees in 2015 has contributed to the breach of the target for primary surplus for that year..\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 June, were heard two witnesses, the former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Labor and Employment, Francisco JoseÌ Pontes Ibiapina and the Director of Special Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Marcos de Oliveira Ferreira. Pontes Ibiapina said that the supplemental budget decrees were published to aid programs as the transfer of resources to States and Municipalities, by the pt [National Employment System] and other programs..\\\\c\\\\cFrom 27 to 29 June happened three meetings, with hearings of nine witnesses, all convened  by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 June, was heard pt [Patrus Ananias], former Ministry of Agrarian Development.

According to former secretary, the values were only monetarily adjusted. The prosecution lawyer pt [JanaiÌna Paschoal] rejected the claims of Maria Fernanda and said that the remuneration per pt [interest rate SELIC] (a benchmark interest rate of the Brazilian economy) is a proof that there was a credit operation. The prosecution reiterates that this statement confirmed the infringement materiality, she concluded. Aldo Rebelo rejected the accusations that the government spent wantonly in 2015, and that year was characterized by fiscal adjustments and efforts to reduce the public spending..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 June, were heard JoaÌo Luiz Guadagnin, Director of the Department of Finance and Production Protection of the Ministry of Agrarian Development, Marcel Mascarenhas dos Santos, Prosecutor of the Central Bank, Fernando Rocha, Deputy Head of the Economic Department of the Central Bank, and Paulo JoseÌ dos Reis Souza, Finance and Control Analyst and Fiscal Policy Secretary on the pt [National Treasury Secretary]..\\\\c\\\\cThe phase of witnesses hearings had concluded on 29 June. A total of 44 witnesses were heard, six convened by prosecution and 38 by defence..\\\\c\\\\cAt the end of the witnesses hearings phase, both the prosecution and the defence lawyers said they were confident about their theses. The prosecution lawyer, Janaina Paschoal, criticized the actions of Rousseff\\\\s defense due the great number of witnesses convened, with clear dilatory intention, and the most of witnesses unknows accurately the facts. The defence lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo also expressed confidence, but said that the process has a political nature and this may interfere in the result. He also pointed out that some senators refused to discuss with the witnesses, because they were already a judgment before the completion of work..\\\\c\\\\cOn 5 July 2016, was heard the board of experts designated by the Committeeâs President, Raimundo Lira on 13 June 2016 meeting, to accomplish an audit in the documents, requested by the defence, and authorized  by the President of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski.The board, composed by the auditors JoaÌo Henrique Pederiva, Prandino Diego Alves and Fernando Alvaro LeaÌo Rincon, submitted the audit report results. According them, the delays in the transfer of payments to the public banks constituted loans. However, they avoided consider whether there was intent of the President and said that this judgment will be up to senators. After, were also heard the assistant by prosecution, Selene PeÌres Nunes and the assistant by defense, Ricardo Lodi Ribeiro. Selene Nunes pointed out that there was willful misconduct by the President, since the operations were hidden by accounting and, later, the government has issued a pt [provisional measure] allowing the payment of debts. The assistant by defense, Ricardo Ribeiro, said that the President has no responsibility for the issue of the supplemental budget decrees because they were submitted to her signature by the technical areas of the ministries and her participation, as demonstrated in the report, was only the signing of these decrees..\\\\c\\\\cOn 6 July, would be carried out a Rousseff\\\\s interrogatory, however she declined to attend the Committee and sent a letter, read entirely by Cardozo. Rousseff defended herself, claiming that she was a victim of a conspiracy, repeating the arguments that have been mentioned from the process beginning. The final arguments by prosecution were delivered to Committee on 12 July, and the final arguments by defense were delivered to Committee on 28 July, for preparation of the final report by rapporteur, Antonio Anastasia..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 August, Anastasia submitted the final report, concluding by Rousseff\\\\s culpability. On 3 August, the document was discussed by the Committee. JoaÌo Correia Serra, prosecution lawyer in lieu, praised Anastasia\\\\s report and stressed the known centralizing temperament of Rousseff, that reinforces the impossibility of the withdrawn President not being aware or not directly commanded the acts for which she was accused. Otherwise, Cardozo said that he was sure that Anastasia\\\\s report does not evinced that Rousseff has committed crimes, and accused the rapporteur, despite his aptitude and usual brilliance, managed his actions within the opinion of his party. On 4 August, the report was voted and approved by 14-5 vote, closing the work of the Committee and following for voting in the Senate floor on 9 August, chaired by Ricardo Lewandowski, Supreme Federal Court president..\\\\c\\\\cIn a long section, started at 9:40 am on 9 August and lasted over sixteen hours, the Senate floor approved on early morning of 10 August, the final report of Anastasia. By 59-21 vote, the indictments against Dilma Rousseff had upheld, ending the penultimate phase of the process, called pronunciation and determining the final judgment in the Senate, beginning on 25 August. In this judgment, two-thirds of 81 senators are necessary to remove the President from office and make her ineligible for office, for eight years subsequent to 1 January 2019, when her second term would end..\\\\c\\\\cThe last phase of the trial has three steps:.\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 August, began the witnesses inquiries, in a stired section, that lasted over fifteen hours. By prosecution, had convened two witnesses, Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, procurator of the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), author of the report recommending the rejection of 2014 accounts, and Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho JuÌnior, auditor of TCU. Oliveira was inquired as informant and not witness, as decided by Lewandowski, after Cardozo accused him that made its report based in a biased understanding. Oliveira refused, claiming that only fulfilled a recommendation to adopt a less tolerant rule came from TCU. Oliveira reiterated that Rousseff broke budget laws in 2014 and also in 2015. In the condition of informant, Oliveira complaints cannot be considered as evidence for the process, but as technical information. The next prosecution witness inquired, D\\\\Avila Carvalho, reiterates that Rousseff disguised the accounting and was responsible for delaying transfers to state banks. Cardozo also tried to desqualify D\\\\Avila as witness, accusing him of biased conduct, because he helped the prosecutor Oliveira to draft the TCU report. Cardozo pleaded that was a clearly an unethical situation that violates the principle of impartiality. However, Lewandowski denied the request..\\\\c\\\\cThe inquiries continued on 26 and 27 August. Six witness were convened by defence: pt [Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo], economist, Geraldo Luiz Mascarenhas Prado, legal advisor, pt [Luiz ClaÌudio Costa], Ministry of Education, Nelson Barbosa, former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management, Esther Dweck, former Secretary of Federal Budget and Ricardo Ribeiro Lodi, Law professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. Dweck was dispensed by Lewandowski, since there would be a conflict of interest, once she was being contracted for the office of Gleisi Hoffmann, one of the senators opposed to impeachment. Gonzaga Belluzzo  and Ribeiro Lodi were heard in the condition of informant..\\\\c\\\\cBelluzo said that interruption of a mandate achieved by universal suffrage is something that should require very special care. It could only be done in extreme situations, and that trial had not facing it..\\\\c\\\\cFor Mascarenhas Prado, by signing the decrees, the President acted in reliance on the advice of his subordinates, which attested to the legality of acts. As for ClaÌudio Costa, the supplementary credit decrees were used in educational programs. The senador CaÌssio Cunha Lima refused, saying that crime is not the expansion of universities and technical schools, but the lack of Congress authorization for such decrees..\\\\c\\\\cNelson Barbosa said that decrees provides more leeway to the administration of funds, when the budget is limited, and are edited by experienced officials. Pro-impeachment senators insisted that those actions have aggravated the economic crisis that facing the country. Barbosa said that the crisis was due to various internal and external factors. At last, Ribeiro Lodi stated that the decrees issued by the President in July and August 2015 were not considered violations until then by TCU and at that moment, when the decrees were issued, this understanding did not exist..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 August, Rousseff attended the Senate, to defend herself..\\\\c\\\\c(CNN) Brazil\\\\s first female president is out of a job, but not barred from the ballot if she wants to run again.\\n',\n"," 'Philippines â United States relations (Filipino: Ugnayang Pilipinas at Estados Unidos) are bilateral relations between the United States of America and its former colony the Republic of the Philippines. Relations between the United States and the Philippines have historically been strong and have been been described as a Special Relationship.[citation needed]The United States is the Philippines\\\\ closest ally in the world,[citation needed] the Philippines being one of the oldest Asian partners of the U.S. and a strategic major non-NATO ally. The United States has consistently been cited as one of the Filipinos\\\\ favorite nations in the world, with 90% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and 91% viewing Americans favorably in 2002, 90% of Filipinos viewing U.S. influence positively in 2011, 85% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and Americans favorably in 2013, and 92% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. favorably in 2015, and 89% having confidence in United States president, Barack Obama in 2014, making the Philippines the most pro-American country in the world..\\\\c\\\\cThis article discusses PhilippineâAmerican relations after Philippine independence from the United States in 1946, while the article History of the Philippines (1898â1946) describes the history of the Philippines during American colonial rule..\\\\c\\\\cPursuant to the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the United States maintained and operated major facilities at Clark Air Base until November 1991, and at Subic Bay Naval Complex and several small subsidiary installations in the Philippines until November 1992. In July 1991, negotiators from the two countries reached agreement on a draft treaty providing for the clean-up and turn over of Clark to the Philippine government in 1992, and for the lease of Subic Bay Naval Base by the U.S. for ten years. By 1991, operations at Clark had already been scaled back because of the end of the Cold War, with the last combat aircraft leaving in 1990, before the base was heavily damaged by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo..\\\\c\\\\cOn September 16, 1991, the Philippine Senate rejected the bases treaty by a slim margin, and despite further efforts to salvage the situation, the two sides could not reach an agreement. As a result, the Philippine Government informed the U.S. on December 6, 1991, that it would have one year to complete withdrawal. That withdrawal went smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule, with the last U.S. forces departing on November 24, 1992. On departure, the U.S. Government turned over assets worth more than $1.3 billion to the Philippines, including an airport and ship-repair facility. Agencies formed by the Philippine Government have converted the former military bases for civilian commercial use, with Subic Bay serving as a flagship for that effort. The Philippine government on July 16, 2015 announced that it will revive a US-built deep-water naval base in Subic Bay..\\\\c\\\\cThe post-U.S. bases era has seen U.S.-Philippine relations improved and broadened, with a prominent focus on economic and commercial ties while maintaining the importance of the security dimension. investment continues to play an important role in the Philippine economy, while a strong security relationship rests on the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). In February 1998, U.S. and Philippine negotiators concluded the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), paving the way for increased military cooperation under the MDT. The agreement was approved by the Philippine Senate in May 1999 and entered into force on June 1, 1999. Under the VFA, the U.S. has conducted ship visits to Philippine ports and has resumed large combined military exercises with Philippine forces. Key events in the bilateral relationship include the July 4, 1996 declaration by President Ramos of Philippine-American Friendship Day in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Philippine independence. Ramos visited the U.S. in April 1998, and then-President Estrada visited in July 2000. President Arroyo met with President Bush in an official working visit in November 2001 and made a state visit in Washington on May 19, 2003. President Bush made a state visit to the Philippines on October 18, 2003, during which he addressed a joint session of the Philippine Congressâthe first American President to do so since Dwight D. Eisenhower. There are regular U.S. cabinet-level and congressional visits to the Philippines as well..\\\\c\\\\cPresident Arroyo repeatedly stressed the close friendship between the Philippines and the U.S. and her desire to expand bilateral ties further. Both governments tried to revitalize and strengthen their partnership by working toward greater security, prosperity, and service to Filipinos and Americans alike. Inaugurated into office on the same day as President Bush, President Arroyo lent strong support to the Global War on Terrorism. In October 2003, the U.S. designated the Philippines as a Major non-NATO ally. That same month, the Philippines joined the select group of countries to have ratified all 12 UN counterterrorism conventions..\\\\c\\\\cThe annual Balikatan (Shoulder-to-Shoulder) bilateral military exercises contribute directly to the Philippine armed forces\\\\ efforts to root out Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah terrorists and bring development to formerly terrorist-plagued areas, notably Basilan and Jolo. They include not only combined military training but also civil-military affairs and humanitarian projects. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program is the largest in the Pacific and the third-largest in the world, and a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) was signed in November 2002. Similarly, law enforcement cooperation has reached new levels: U.S. and Philippine agencies have cooperated to bring charges against numerous terrorists, to implement the countries\\\\ extradition treaty, and to train thousands of Filipino law enforcement officers. There is a Senior Law Enforcement Advisor helping the Philippine National Police with its Transformation Program..\\\\c\\\\cworks closely with the Philippines to reduce poverty and increase prosperity. fully supports Philippine efforts to root out corruption, to open economic opportunity, and to invest in health and education. USAID programs support the \\\\Philippines\\\\ war on poverty as well as the government\\\\s reform agenda in critical areas, including anti-money laundering, rule of law, tax collection, and trade and investment. Other USAID programs have bolstered the government\\\\s efforts to heal divisions in Philippine society through a focus on conflict resolution, livelihood enhancement for former combatants, and economic development in Mindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, among the poorest areas in the country. Meanwhile, important programs continue in modern family planning, infectious disease control, environmental protection, rural electrification, and provision of basic servicesâas well as PL 480 food aid programs and others, which together totaled $211.3 million. In 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation granted $21 million to the Philippines for a threshold program addressing corruption in revenue administration..\\\\c\\\\cNearly 400,000 Americans visit the Philippines each year. Providing government services to U.S. and other citizens, therefore, constitutes an important aspect of the bilateral relationship. Those services include veterans\\\\ affairs, social security, and consular operations. Benefits to Filipinos from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration totaled $297,389,415 in 2006. Many people-to-people programs exist between the U.S. and the Philippines, including Fulbright, International Visitors, and Aquino Fellowship exchange programs, as well as the U.S. Peace Corps..\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2014, a ten-year pact Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was signed between the U.S. President Barack Obama and the Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines..\\\\c\\\\cTwo-way U.S. merchandise trade with the Philippines amounted to $17.3 billion in 2006 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). According to Philippine Government data, 16% of the Philippines\\\\ imports in 2006 came from the U.S., and about 18% of its exports were bound for America. The Philippines ranks as the 26th-largest export market and the 30th-largest supplier of the United States. Key exports to the U.S. are semiconductor devices and computer peripherals, automobile parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, wheat and animal feeds, and coconut oil. In addition to other goods, the Philippines imports raw and semi-processed materials for the manufacture of semiconductors, electronics and electrical machinery, transport equipment, and cereals and cereal preparations..\\\\c\\\\ctraditionally has been the Philippines\\\\ largest foreign investor, with about $6.6 billion in estimated investment as of end-2005 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). Since the late 1980s, the Philippines has committed itself to reforms that encourage foreign investment as a basis for economic development, subject to certain guidelines and restrictions in specified areas. Under President Ramos, the Philippines expanded reforms, opening the power generation and telecommunications sectors to foreign investment, as well as securing ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement and membership in the World Trade Organization. As noted earlier, President Arroyo\\\\s administration has generally continued such reforms despite opposition from vested interests and nationalist blocs. A major obstacle has been and will continue to be constitutional restrictions on, among others, foreign ownership of land and public utilities, which limits maximum ownership to 40%..\\\\c\\\\cOver the last two decades, the relatively closed Philippine economy has been opened significantly by foreign exchange deregulation, foreign investment and banking liberalization, tariff and market barrier reduction, and foreign entry into the retail trade sector. The Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 opened opportunities for U.S. firms to participate in the power industry in the Philippines. Information and communications technologies, backroom operations such as call centers, and regional facilities or shared-service centers are likewise leading investment opportunities..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the visit by President Benigno Aquino III to Washington DC, on July 7, 2012, the US-Philippine Society was launched. It is a non-profit independent organisation tasked for generating awareness about the Philippines in the US. The last board meeting was conducted by the society on January 24, 2013..\\\\c\\\\cIn its 2013 Special 301 Report, the Office of the United States Trade Representatives wrote The United States looks to the Philippines to take important steps to address piracy over the internet, in particular with respect to notorious online markets. It is speculated that pressure from the United States contributed to the complaint filed by Philippine Association of the Record Industry against the torrent website KickassTorrents, resulting in its seizure by Philippine authorities on June 13, 2013..\\\\c\\\\cAssistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt M. Campbell said in January 2011 that the United States will help boost the capacity of the Philippines to patrol their own waters, including the Spratly islands..\\\\c\\\\cThe 1951 mutual-defense treaty was reaffirmed with the November 2011 Manila Declaration. United States Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert suggested that LCS or surveillance aircraft may be deployed to the Philippines. And the Philippines is considering the proposal. These rotational deployments will help replace some of the American presence in the area that was given up when the permanent American bases in the Philippines were closed under President Bush..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2012 the Philippines and the United States conducted joint military exercises. As of 2012, a U.S. military contingent of 600, including Navy Seals and Seabees are stationed indefinitely in the Southern Philippines, in a declared non-combatant role to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in operations against the al-Quaida-linked Abu Sayyaf terrorist group primarily on the island of Basilan in western Mindanao and the Sulu islands, in particular Jolo, a long-time stronghold of Abu Sayyaf..\\\\c\\\\cThe Scarborough Shoal standoff with China and the ongoing Spratly islands dispute has caused the Philippines to consider stronger military ties with the United States. In 2012, a senior Philippine defense official said that as long as they have prior clearance from the Philippine government, American troops, warships and aircraft could once again use their former naval and air facilities of Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base. In 2013, Foreign Secretary, Albert del Rosario clarified that, due to constitutional constraints, establishment of a US military facility could only be allowed if it would be under the control of the Philippine military. The deal will reportedly include shared access to Philippines military but not civilian facilities..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a 2013 visit to the Philippines, Deputy Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter said that the main security issues that the USA was working with the Philippines  were:.\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2014, a ten-year pact (EDCA â Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement) was signed between the U.S. President, Barack Obama and the Philippine President, Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines..\\\\c\\\\cmaintains an embassy in Manila and a consulate in Cebu.

The South American country\\'s Senate voted 61-20 Wednesday to remove President Dilma Rousseff from office, finding her guilty of breaking budgetary laws in an impeachment trial. Temer, 75, inherits a tattered economy, along with the keys to the presidential palace in Brasilia, the nation\\'s capital. He met with his Cabinet and promised to tackle unemployment. \"I am not saying it is an easy task, since we have almost 12 million people unemployed in this country,\" he said, according to a CNN translation.\\\\c\\\\c\"It\\'s a scary number, and there is nothing less dignified than unemployment.\" Photos: The rise and fall of Dilma Rousseff Freedom fighter â As young Marxist during Brazil\\'s military dictatorship, Dilma Rousseff was charged by a military court with subversion and jailed in November 1970.\\\\c\\\\cRousseff has said she was tortured with electrical shocks by her captors during her imprisonment.\\\\c\\\\cHide Caption 1 of 6 Photos: The rise and fall of Dilma Rousseff Chief of staff â As former president Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva\\'s chief of staff, Rousseff took on several high-profile roles.\\\\c\\\\cShe announced the discovery of Brazil\\'s pre-salt oil reserves, which would have made the country self-sustainable and could have produced up to 100 billion barrels of oil.\\\\c\\\\cBut the reserve, discovered in 2009, still remains untapped.\\\\c\\\\cHide Caption 2 of 6 Photos: The rise and fall of Dilma Rousseff Presidential hopeful â Rousseff campaigning for the presidency in 2010.\\\\c\\\\cHide Caption 3 of 6 Photos: The rise and fall of Dilma Rousseff President â Dilma Rousseff is sworn in to her first term on January 1, 2011, becoming Brazil\\'s first female president.\\\\c\\\\cShe\\'s seen here with running mate Michel Temer, who has now succeeded her as president.\\\\c\\\\cHide Caption 4 of 6 Photos: The rise and fall of Dilma Rousseff Fighting for political life â Rousseff gestures during her testimony during her impeachment trial at the National Congress in Brasilia on August 29, 2016.\\\\c\\\\cHide Caption 5 of 6 Photos: The rise and fall of Dilma Rousseff Deposed â After the Senate voted for her impeachment, Rousseff was officially removed from office Wednesday afternoon.\\\\c\\\\cHide Caption 6 of 6 A general election is scheduled for 2018. Wednesday\\'s vote marks the culmination of a contentious impeachment process that has dragged on for months.\\\\c\\\\cIt\\'s a political crisis that ordinary Brazilians could do well without as the country, which just hosted the Summer Olympics in Rio, is trying to pull itself out of recession. The Senate\\'s decision is a major blow for Rousseff, a member of the Workers\\' Party, but it might not mark the end of her political career. While the vote to oust her from office was decisive, a motion to bar her from holding any public office for the next eight years failed. Rousseff, 68, a former Marxist guerrilla, said earlier this week that she had committed no crime and said she was proud she\\'d been \"faithful to my commitment to the nation.\" JUST WATCHED Rousseff impeachment trial in final phase Replay More Videos ...\\\\c\\\\cLindbergh Farias of the Workers\\' Party made an impassioned plea against Rousseff\\'s impeachment. \"This is a farce.\\\\c\\\\cThere are two types of senators, the one that know there was no crime of responsibility and vote against the impeachment and those that know there was no crime of responsibility and vote in favor,\" he said, shouting from the Senate floor. Sen.\\\\c\\\\cRonaldo Caiado of the Democrats argued that Rousseff should be ousted, arguing that lawmakers weren\\'t the ones behind the impeachment process. \"It began because 90% of the population has said loudly, no more (Workers\\' Party),\" he said. In May, Rousseff called the impeachment proceedings an attempt at a power grab by her rivals.\\\\c\\\\cShe said her government has long been the target of political sabotage. \"When Brazil or when a president is impeached for a crime that they have not committed, the name we have for this in democracy -- it\\'s not an impeachment, it is a coup,\" she said after the Senate voted to launch the proceedings. The heir-apparent to former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Rousseff was re-elected by a narrow margin in 2014, but a recession and a cross-party corruption scandal put an end to any political goodwill she might have earned, eventually leading to her ouster. A statement from the spokesman for Ban Ki-moon said the UN Secretary-General had \"taken note\" of the impeachment process and Temer\\'s swearing in.',\n"," '- Quick facts: A 5.6 magnitude shook Green Country Saturday.

This season began nearly five months before the official start, with Hurricane Alex forming in the Northeastern Atlantic in mid-January. Tropical Storm Bonnie followed in late May, which was the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012. In June, tropical storms Colin and Danielle formed and became the earliest third and fourth named storms in the Atlantic in recorded history. In August, Hurricane Earl killed 67 people after striking Belize and Mexico..\\\\c\\\\cTo this point, most forecasting groups have expected this season to be an above average season, due to a combination of factors including an expected transition to La NinÌa and warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Western Atlantic, despite near-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Main Development Region near Cape Verde. So far, six of the eight developed storms have impacted land, and 5 of those storms caused loss of life, directly or indirectly..\\\\c\\\\cAhead of and during the season, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Colorado State University (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014â16 El NinÌo event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, two major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 66â103 units..\\\\c\\\\cThe first forecast for the year was issued by CSU on December 10, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. TSR subsequently issued their first outlook for the 2016 season during December 16, 2015 and predicted that activity would be about 20% below the 1950â2015 average, or about 15% below the 2005â2015 average. Specifically they thought that there would be 13 tropical storms, 5 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes and an ACE index of 79 units. A few months later, TSR issued their second prediction for the season during April 6, 2016 and lowered the predicted number of named storms to 12 but raised the number of hurricanes to 6.  On April 14, CSU predicted that the season would be near-normal, predicting 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes with ACE near 93. On April 15, North Carolina State University predicted the season would be very active, with 15-18 named storms, 8-11 hurricanes and 3-5 major hurricanes. A month later, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) released its forecast, predicting a slightly above-average season with 14 named storms and 8 hurricanes. It also predicted  an ACE index of 125, above the defined average ACE index at 103. On May 27, NOAA issued its first outlook calling for a near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10-16 named storms could form, including 4-8 hurricanes of which 1-4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated that there is a 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La NinÌa forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal..\\\\c\\\\cCSU updated their forecast on June 1 to include 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include recently formed Tropical Storm Bonnie. It was again updated on July 1 to include 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, to accommodate for tropical storms Colin and Danielle. On July 5, TSR released their fourth forecast for the season, slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. On August 5, TSR released their final forecast for the season, lowering the numbers to 15 named storms and 7 hurricanes due to the influence that La NinÌa being less than anticipated previously..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 13, an extratropical cyclone over the eastern Atlantic Ocean developed into a subtropical storm. Assigned the name Alex, the system soon developed into a fully tropical hurricaneâthe first such storm in January since Alice in 1955. Alex then made landfall over Terceira Island, Azores, as a strong tropical storm, before becoming extratropical on January 15. The next tropical cyclone developed in late May, originating as a tropical depression on May 27. The next day, the depression developed into Tropical Storm Bonnie, the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012 and the third occurrence since 1951. Bonnie drifted north-northwestwards over the following day, before weakening back into a depression early on May 29, however its remnant low regenerated into a tropical storm a few days later and finally dissipated north of Bermuda on June 5. Simultaneously, a new tropical depression developed near the YucataÌn Peninsula. This depression soon became Tropical Storm Colin on June 5, marking the earliest occurrence of a seasons third named storm since reliable records began, surpassing the previous record set in 1887. On June 20, when Danielle had strengthened into a tropical storm, it also marked the earliest fourth named storm, surpassing the previous record set by Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 by 3 days. However, after Danielle, activity halted as no storms formed in July, an occurrence not seen since 2012. Activity resumed once again with the formation of Hurricane Earl, Tropical Storm Fiona, Hurricane Gaston, and Tropical Depression Eight in the month of August..\\\\c\\\\cThe Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, as of 09:00 UTC on August 28, is 18.9925 units..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 7, the National Hurricane Center noted the potential for an extratropical low about 425 mi (685 km) west-southwest of Bermuda to gain subtropical or tropical characteristics over subsequent days, as it tracked across the central Atlantic. Convection began to coalesce near the center of the low on January 13, leading to the formation of Subtropical Storm Alex about 785 miles (1,260 km) south-southwest of the Azores, at 21:00 UTC. Alex is the first tropical or subtropical storm to form in January since 1978, and only the fourth known tropical or subtropical cyclone formation during the month on record. When Alex became a hurricane at 15:00 UTC on January 14, it marked only the second recorded hurricane formation in January, with the other being Hurricane One in 1938. On January 15, the NHC issued its last advisory on Hurricane Alex, as the system transitioned back into an extratropical cyclone. On January 17, Alex was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone, in the southern Labrador Sea..\\\\c\\\\cOn May 24, the NHC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather resultant from the interaction of a weakening cold front and an upper-level trough. A surface area of low pressure formed late the next day, eventually gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on May 27. Steered west-northwest within an only marginally conducive environment, the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie a day later. The continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclones appearance to degenerate early on May 29, and Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength less than an hour prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina. The depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before regressing to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 15:00 UTC on May 30. However, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression on June 2 amidst more favorable conditions. Late the next day, Bonnie re-strengthened back to a tropical storm due to a burst of convection. Bonnie then weakened to a tropical depression on June 4 and then early on June 5, Bonnie finally dissipated into a remnant low..\\\\c\\\\cUpon formation, a tropical storm warning was hoisted in South Carolina from the Savannah River to the Little River Inlet. Heavy rains associated with Bonnie led to localized flooding, prompting the South Carolina Highway Patrol to close the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Jasper County, South Carolina. Rip currents along the coastline of the Southeast United States led to dozens of water rescues; the body of one 20-year-old man was recovered in Brevard County, Florida, after he drowned, while the body of a 21-year-old man was recovered in New Hanover County, North Carolina, several days after he went missing. In all, Bonnie is estimated to have caused more than $640,000 (2016 USD) in structural damage..\\\\c\\\\cIn early June, a low pressure system entered the Caribbean Sea. The low remained disorganized with only isolated convection, mostly in the eastern quadrant. Convection began to wrap into the center as the storm curved northward into the Gulf of Mexico on June 3. After the low passed over the YucataÌn Peninsula on June 5, the National Hurricane Center upgraded it to Tropical Depression Three and tropical storm warnings were issued for the Big Bend region of Florida. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Colin, just after tropical storm watches were put in place for eastern Florida and Georgia. The formation into a tropical storm marked the earliest formation on record of the third named storm within the Atlantic basin, exceeding the previous record set in 1887 by seven days. Gradually curving northeastwards, Colin remained disorganized as it accelerated towards the coast of Florida on June 6; in their forecast discussion, the NHC noted that their uncertainty in locating the circulation center, instead taking the midpoint between two small-scale circulations. However, a strong burst of convection increased the winds to 50 mph (85 km/h). Maintaining its intensity, Colin continued accelerating to the northeast and made landfall in the Big Bend Region just after 03:00 UTC on June 7. Failing to weaken over land, Colin began undergoing extratropical transition after the increasingly ill-defined circulation moved off the coast of Georgia, and became fully extratropical hours later. It remained extratropical and intact for nearly a week before merging with another extratropical cyclone on June 14..\\\\c\\\\cMuch of Florida experienced heavy rainfall, and flash flood and tornado warnings were issued. At least three people drowned along the Florida Panhandle due to rip currents, and a fourth remains missing but is presumed dead. Damage from Colin in the Tampa Bay area totaled $10,000 (2016 USD)..\\\\c\\\\cOn June 14, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave located in the western Caribbean Sea. Tracking steadily to the west-northwest, the disturbance slowly moved over the YucataÌn Peninsula; during that time, development was not expected due to land interaction. However, on June 18, the disturbance exited land and moved over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, upon which it spawned a low pressure area with a well-defined circulation center. A further increase in organization occurred the next day despite strong wind shear, prompting the NHC to upgrade the low to Tropical Depression Four. Concurrently, the Government of Mexico issued tropical storm warnings for part of the state of Veracruz. The depression continued to slowly organize, and after a reconnaissance aircraft measured gale-force winds on June 20, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Danielle. This marked the earliest formation on record of the fourth named storm within the Atlantic basin, preceding the previous record set by Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 by 3 days. Hours later, Danielle reached peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Maintaining strength, Danielle made landfall north of Tuxpan just before June 21. Rapid weakening followed and Danielle dissipated by noon that same day..\\\\c\\\\cAcross much of Veracruz, officials suspended school activities and the Port of Veracruz was temporarily closed. Flooding in the Pueblo Viejo Municipality affected 1,200 families and prompted activation of public shelters. In Ciudad Madero, Tamaulipas, a homeless man drowned in a storm drain during a flash flood..\\\\c\\\\cThe NHC began monitoring a tropical wave in the central Atlantic on July 28. The disturbances rapid movement prevented development for several days until it passed Jamaica on August 2, when a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the presence of a closed circulation; already possessing tropical storm-force winds, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl. Steered generally westward by a ridge over the South United States, Earl intensified amid warm ocean temperatures and low shear, attaining hurricane intensity and peaking with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on August 3. Earl made landfall just southwest of Belize City, Belize around 06:00 UTC on August 4. It quickly weakened over land, although it emerged over the southern Bay of Campeche the following day while still maintaining minimal tropical storm intensity. A Hurricane Hunters mission flew into Earl later on August 5, unexpectedly measuring 60 mph (95 km/h) winds. The cyclone maintained these winds up to landfall just south of Veracruz, Veracruz around 02:00 on August 6. Once inland, Earl quickly weakened and the storms circulation dissipated by 15:00 UTC..\\\\c\\\\cThe precursor to Earl brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles and Greater Antilles. Strong winds in the Dominican Republic downed a power line onto a bus, subsequently causing a fire that killed six people. A boat crash in SamanaÌ Bay killed seven people. Significant impacts were reported in Belize after Earl moved ashore as a hurricane, including downed trees and power lines, blown transformers, damaged or ripped-off roofs, coastal and inland flooding, and a significant storm surge. Landslides in Mexico following the storms second landfall resulted in an additional 54 deaths..\\\\c\\\\cLate on August 14, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection off the western coast of Africa for potential development. Steered west-northwest and eventually northwest, the wave organized amid favorable atmospheric conditions, gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 03:00 UTC on August 17.[citation needed] Later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fiona. Only modest strengthening occurred during the next four days, resulting in a low peak intensity, with one-minute sustained winds of 50 mph. By August 22, Fiona had weakened back into a depression south-southeast of Bermuda. Fiona managed to move slowly to the northwest with irregular pulses of thunderstorms flaring up, but southeast of the low-level center. Eventually, increasing wind shear took its toll on the storm and it was declared a remnant low by the NHC on August 23. The remnant low then dissipated soon thereafter.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cOn August 18, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a strong tropical wave that was about to move off the coast of Africa. It moved off the coast by August 20, with conditions becoming increasingly favorable for development. The low eventually was able to attain a closed circulation west of Cape Verde on August 22, and was declared Tropical Depression Seven shortly thereafter. It then strengthened into a tropical storm by August 23 and was named Gaston. On August 24, during a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm, they found that Gaston had hurricane-force winds, so they declared it a hurricane at 12:15 AM AST. No further strengthening occurred as wind shear associated with a nearby stationary front and dry air weakened Gaston into a tropical storm only twelve hours later. Weakening continued, with Gastons winds lowering to 60 mph later that day. Through the evening hours, convection reorganized, allowing Gaston to restrengthen.[citation needed] On August 27, Gaston restrengthened back into a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 85 mph. The next day, the storm intensified into a 90 mph Category 1 hurricane, and then on 15:00 UTC a Category 2 hurricane with maximum winds of 100 mph. On 21:00 UTC, Gaston was designated as a Category 3 hurricane, the first of the season..\\\\c\\\\cAs of 5:00 p.m. AST (21:00 UTC) August 28, Hurricane Gaston is located within 20 nautical miles of 30Â°48â²N 55Â°06â²W\\\\ufeff / \\\\ufeff30.8Â°N 55.1Â°W\\\\ufeff / 30.8; -55.1\\\\ufeff (Gaston), about 580 miles (935 km) east of Bermuda.

The minimum barometric pressure is 962 mbar (hPa; 28.41 inHg), and the system is moving northwest at 4 knots (5 mph; 7 km/h). Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center of Gaston..\\\\c\\\\cFor latest official information, see:.\\\\c\\\\cAs of 11:00 a.m. AST (15:00 UTC) August 28, Tropical Depression Eight is located near 31Â°30â²N 70Â°00â²W\\\\ufeff / \\\\ufeff31.5Â°N 70.0Â°W\\\\ufeff / 31.5; -70.0\\\\ufeff (Eight), about 310 miles (500 km) west of Bermuda, or about 405 miles (655 km/h) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

An impeachment request against Rousseff was accepted by Eduardo Cunha, then president of the Chamber of Deputies, on 2 December 2015. Rousseff has been charged for responsibility crimes in the execution of her duties, including administrative misconduct and disregarding the federal budget, in violation of article 85, items V and VI of the Brazilian Constitution and the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law], article 36. However, a large number of scholars and witnesses during the hearing phase of the process, stating it is not related to responsibility crimes. In course of the process, two of the six supplemental budget decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress, were considered neutral from the fiscal perspective and removed of the charges..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to the impeachment request, Rousseff was also accused of omission concerning irregularities in Petrobras that, facing serious facts investigated by Operation Car Wash while occupying the office of president of Brazil, failed to fend off the suspects. Also according to the report, the fact is aggravated by Rousseff having been president of the board of directors in the Brazilian oil company, when the investigated facts occurred, including the controversial acquisition of Pasadena Refining System, cited on page 3 of the impeachment request. According to this request, her omission would indicate criminal responsibility.  However, these charges of omission were not included in the process, since a request indicting the involvement of Rousseff in the suspicious purchase of Pasadena had archived, by the lawful impediment to investigate the President for previous act to its mandate.On August 31st of 2016, President Rousseff was removed from office by a vote of 61-20..\\\\c\\\\cAlleged graft occurred while President Rousseff was still part of the board of directors of state-owned energy company Petrobras from 2003 to 2010. One million Brazilians protested in the streets calling for Rousseff\\\\s impeachment. No evidence that Rousseff herself was involved in the scheme has been found and she has denied any prior knowledge of the graft. Further investigation found that there were various offshore accounts and collections of art that were held by those involved in the controversy..\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2014, an investigation by Brazilian Federal Police called Operation Car Wash placed Petrobras at the center of what may be the largest corruption scandal in Brazil\\\\s history. On 14 November 2014, police raids across six Brazilian states netted prominent Brazilian politicians and businessmenâincluding some Petrobras directorsâwho were placed under investigation in regards to suspicious contracts worth $22 billion..\\\\c\\\\cUnder Rousseff, the government of Brazil has also been accused of carrying out fiscal pedaling â an accounting maneuver through which the government gives the false impression that it received more money than was spent. The government failed to provide funds to public and private banks that make payments for a number of public expense programs, including social assistance programs like Bolsa FamiÌlia, forcing the banks to finance programs without receiving government compensation. The government\\\\s apparent motive was to improve its fiscal outcomes for the years 2012 to 2014. The Tribunal de Contas da UniaÌo (TCU), in a unanimous decision, considered this operation a violation of fiscal responsibility. TCU is an auxiliary of the legislative body and has no legal power; however their decision put the National Congress under pressure to begin the process of impeachment of President Rousseff..\\\\c\\\\cRousseff was reelected in the 2014 general election, winning 51.64% of the votes. The election was one of the most contentious presidential elections in the country\\\\s history. After being sworn in on the 1st of January 2015, she started her second term weakened, mainly due to the national recession that started in 2014 and allegations of corruption, which led to a 9% approval rating in a survey by Ibope held in July of that yearâthe lowest approval rating ever for the president. On 15 March 2015, several protests began, gathering hundreds of thousands of Brazilians across the country to demand the impeachment or the resignation of Rousseff, among other issues..\\\\c\\\\cBeyond the violations of the budget law, Rousseff and her government were increasingly tainted by corruption allegations. The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Cunha, was investigated in Operation Car Wash, under allegations of receiving bribes and keeping secret Swiss bank accounts. Consequently, Cunha was in danger of losing his mandate as the Ethics Council of the Chamber moved a lawsuit against him. Rumors emerged about attempts to agreement between the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and the Workers\\\\ Party (PT), in order to end this process, which he strongly denied. When the Workers\\\\ Party announced its support for the wedge term loss on the Board of Ethics, he would have accepted the request for impeachment as an instrument of blackmail..\\\\c\\\\cIn his defense, Cunha said The receipt of the complaint has clearly defined reasons, when it talks about direct participation in the conduct described in what were then budget decrees. I haven\\\\t issued and I will not issue any judgment on the accusation against the President of the Republic, even more if it\\\\s a personal matter. I\\\\m just sticking to facts typified (in the law). He also stressed that Rousseff signed six decrees with additional credits, which increased the 2015 federal spending in non-compliance with the annual budget law and without approval of the Congress..\\\\c\\\\cInconsistent and unfounded are the reasons for this request. There is no illegal act committed by me [...] I would never accept any kind of bargain, much less those that threaten the free functioning of democratic institutions in this country..\\\\c\\\\cIn turn, Rousseff denied any attempt to forge a deal to save Cunha and get rid of impeachment, as well as agreements to interfere with the Ethics Board in exchange for the approval of a pt [CPMF] (Provisional Contribution on the Movement or Transmission of Values and Credits and Financial Nature Rights), which was another great need of the government. At a news conference on 2 December, she said that she never would accept or agree with any kind of bargain..\\\\c\\\\cShe lied on national television network and this is very serious. If she had not participated directly I would not speak..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the pronouncement of the president, Cunha said Rousseff lied to the nation when she said she would not participate in any bargain and that the government had much to explain to the country. Cunha claimed he was not aware of negotiations and that he had not met Jaques Wagner (the supposed intermediary in negotiations with Rousseff). Declaring himself against the Workers\\\\ Party, he said he would rather not have the three votes from the party in the Council of Ethics..\\\\c\\\\cPolitical scientists heard by AgeÌncia Brasil on December 2015, commented on the political crisis. They stated that Rousseff\\\\s inability to negotiate with Congress, in addition to the political system, which allows the fragmenting and great number of political parties in Brazil, caused a loss of governability. Moreover, the opposition confronted Rousseff since elections on 2014, refuting the electoral results and calling for a recount of votes. Her campaign accounts was also disputed and the impeachment threat has destabilized the government. However, the outbreak of the process could be beneficial for Rousseff, who would be free from blackmail and could potentially reorganize her government. Political scientists believed Cunha could lose his mandate and that the opposition would try to push the process in Congress for 2016 in order to mitigate the electoral ecstasy and act of revenge that was the host of the application..\\\\c\\\\cIn CNT/MDA polls performed in March 2015, only 10.8% of Brazilians approved of Rouseff\\\\s government and 59.7% wanted her impeached. In July 2015, this number had risen to 62.8%. By April 2016, in polls performed by Datafolha Institute, 61% of Brazilians believed that Rousseff should have been impeached..\\\\c\\\\cSince 2012, a total of 37 requests for impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff have been presented to the Chamber of Deputies. However, only one request was accepted by then president of the Chamber Eduardo Cunha. The accepted request for impeachment was submitted by former congressman and attorney pt [HeÌlio Bicudo] and attorneys pt [Miguel Reale JuÌnior] and pt [Janaina Paschoal]. The request was based on allegations of omission concerning irregularities in Petrobras, fiscal responsibility crimes, and budgetary mismanagement..\\\\c\\\\cIn the course of Operation Car Wash, many illegal and suspicious operations were investigated, including the purchase of the Pasadena Refinery by Petrobras, a business that has proved extremely unfavourable to Brazil, according to the impeachment request. The financial losses were higher than R$700 million (US$320 million). Roussef was president of the Board of Directors of Petrobras and gave as excuse, a mistake concerning a contractual clause. According to the report, the President insisted in thesis that the allegations would be a kind of coup, mere attempt to weaken Petrobras, always emphasizing its expertise in economy and energy sector, namely, the President insisted on the company\\\\s financial health. She stepped down in Petrobras only in February 2015, when the situation was already untenable..\\\\c\\\\cThe report also denounces a corrupt scheme involving shady deals of former President Lula, who intermediated business of the Brazilian construction company Norberto Odebrecht in Cuba and Angola, which Rousseff had knowledge that were for the purpose of money laundering of corruption at Petrobras. Some international companies were chosen to be encouraged and, thereafter, participating in unrealistic bids, drain the state-owned company, giving back much of the values through seemingly licit donations. In statements taken from accused in Operation Car Wash, was found that Lula and Dilma knew of the bribery scheme in Petrobras..\\\\c\\\\cRousseff has edit in the years 2014 and 2015, six unnumbered decrees that resulted in the provision of additional credits to social programs with electoral purposes, without authorization from Congress. These values were in the amount of R$18.5 billion (US$6.9 billion) and were contracted in official financial institutions without the necessary legislative authorization, even with the targets set not being complied in the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law] and the pt [Annual Budgetary Law]. To obtain these additional credits, the target of 2014 was reduced by the end of 2014 by R$67 billion (US$25 billion), at the request of the president. The same conduct of the accused was committed in 2015. Rousseff, by means of decrees, authorized in the years 2014 and 2015, the opening credit, disregarding the Annual Budgetary Law and the Federal Constitution, precisely to allow the provision of additional resources when it was known that the primary superavit target in the Budget forecast was not being fulfilled, and would not be fulfilled..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2011 and 2014, the Union has held illegal credit operations from no transfer of funds to the national financial system entities controlled by the State. That practice was taken from financial advances made by official financial institutions, such as Caixa EconoÌmica Federal and Banco do Brasil for finance social programs of responsibility of the Federal Government. These transactions were reported in 2015 by Tribunal de Contas da UniaÌo and, according to the report, aimed at election results..\\\\c\\\\cThe Union contracted Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil as operators by Federal Government social programs. For this purpose, the Union should pass along directly from the pt [National Treasury Secretary] account, the necessary resources for the realization of programs each month, more precisely, would be obliged to transfer to the financial institutions the equivalent values for the equalization of interest rates, expenditures and legal transfers. But the government has not done these refunds and the contracted financial system entities made payments to programs beneficiaries with own resources and hence promoted the credit constitution in his favor against the Union. This procedure is a form of mutual credit, or similar operation and in accordance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law, art. 36, is prohibited to carry out credit operations between a state financial institution and the member of the Federation that controls it, as the borrower. The total balance of these liabilities by the end of August 2014 was R$1.74 billion (US$740 million). Of an amount of R$7.8 billion (US$2.9 billion) spent on subsidies in the programs between 2009 and 2014, only R$1.6 billion (US$590 million) was transferred by the Union..\\\\c\\\\cBy the end of 2014, Rousseff sent to the National Congress the PLN Nr. 362014, to change the pt [Budgetary Directives Law] aimed at modifying the rules of the primary superavit. Thus, has demonstrated knowledge of the results of the public accounts and which has taken the necessary steps to regularize them. However, he did just to meet your interest, as sought avoid being accused of a crime committed for not meet the fiscal targets set out in law..\\\\c\\\\cBoth the Federal Constitution and Article 4 of Law 1079/50, establish that give rise the impediment of the President the fact that attempt against probity in administration and against the budget law. Are crimes of responsibility against the budget law, order or authorize the opening of credit in disagreement with the limits set by the Senate, not well-founded in budget law or in additional credit law or inobservance of legal prescription;(Law Nr. 10028, 2000) and fail to promote or to order the full settlement of credit operations in anticipation of budget revenue, including related interest and other charges, until the end of the fiscal period; (Law Nr. 10028, 2000)..\\\\c\\\\cTherefore, there is a political violation, which may lead to the impeachment, by Legislative trial, and there is a civil offense, which entails indemnities and mandate cassation by the Judiciary. When the author of conduct is the President, also commit crime of responsibility, pursuant to art. 10 of Law n. 1079/50, amended by Law Nr. 10028/2000..\\\\c\\\\cThere were 37 requests for impeachment filed with the Chamber of Deputies by September 2015, against Dilma Rousseff, but the president\\\\s home only received the written request of pt [HeÌlio Bicudo] and the lawyers pt [Miguel Reale JuÌnior] and pt [Janaina Paschoal]. The social movement pro-impeachment (such as the Free Brazil Movement and pt [Come to the Street Movement]) decided to join Bicudo\\\\s request. It also had the support of parliamentarians and civil society, which organized a petition in support of the impeachment of the President of the Republic..\\\\c\\\\cLawyers, in the document presented to the House, tried to associate Dilma Rousseff with Operation Car Wash, cited failure in case of corruption, investigated influence peddling against former President Luiz InaÌcio Lula da Silva and fiscal pedaling. In addition, it contributed to support the request of six decrees signed by the president in the fiscal year of 2015 in disagreement with the law guidelining the budget, which were published without permission of the Congress..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the acceptance of the request, a special committee was formed in the Chamber of Deputies to decide on its admissibility. It began with the testimony of the authors of the request, followed by a presentation of Rousseff\\\\s defense. Meanwhile, street protests for and against the impeachment occurred periodically throughout the country. The committee\\\\s report was favorable to impeaching the President: 38 deputies approved the report while 27 did not..\\\\c\\\\cOn 17 April 2016, the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the Brazilian Parliament) concluded a general vote for the admission of the impeachment process. 367 members voted for impeachment, while 137 voted against, 7 abstained and 2 were absent from the session. The internal rules of the house stated that the process would be admitted only if it received at least 342 votes for, between the 513 sitting members. On the following day, the president of the Chamber, Eduardo Cunha, delivered the process to the Senate, upper legislative house, which follow the procedure and judged the case. On 5 May 2016, Teori Zavascki, judge of Supreme Federal Court decided that Eduardo Cunha must to step down from the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies and suspend his mandate, because he is facing a corruption trial. The decision was later endorsed by all eleven judges of Court and has not affected the process of impeachment against Dilma Rousseff..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the vote held in the Chamber on 17 April to allow the charges against the President to be presented to the Senate, the process was delivered by Cunha to the Senate and confirmed with a 55â22 vote on 12 May, in a section that lasted more than 20 hours, resulting in the suspension of Rousseff\\\\s presidential powers and duties up to 180 days. During this period, while the judgment of the process occurs (which decides whether the president should be convicted and removed from office, or acquitted with powers and duties restored), Rousseff\\\\s vice-president Michel Temer will serve as acting president..\\\\c\\\\cIn the Brazilian political system, the President and Vice President form a single electoral coalition. However, their terms are constitutionally separate. Michel Temer was President of the Chamber of Deputies during the Fernando Henrique Cardoso presidential mandate, from 1995 to 2002. Mr. Temer is a member of PMDB, which declared moving to opposition to Dilma Rousseff government on March 2016. According to some newspapers such as The Guardian, for those desperate for change, Temer represents salvation. Others, more concerned about the countryâs fragile democracy, believe he is the perpetrator of a coup. A separate proposal to impeach Michael Temer as Acting President and Vice President has been made..\\\\c\\\\cA CNT/MDA poll published on 8 June 2016, indicates that 11.3% of Brazilians approved and 28% censured the acting government of President Temer. For 30.2% of respondents, Temer\\\\s government is ordinary, while 30.5% not answered. The survey revealed that 46.6% of Brazilians believed that the corruption in government Temer could be equal to that experienced in government Rousseff. Also according to the poll, 28.3% believe that corruption could be lessen, while 18.6% estimated that it could be even greaten. Regarding to lawfulness in the process of impeachment, 61.5% agreeded with the conduction of the process, 33.3% answered negatively and 5.2% not answered. According to the survey agency, the CNT/MDA heard 2,002 people in 137 municipalities in 25 federative units from 2 to 5 June. The margin of error was 2.2 percentage points, with 95% of reliability..\\\\c\\\\cA poll of Ipsos Consulting, by early July 2016, concluded that 16% of Brazilians had preferred Temer definitely in office. For 20%, Rousseff should be acquitted and reconducted to office to conclude her four-year mandate. 52% answered that both, Temer or Roussef, whoever that assume the command of the nation, must call new elections for president. However, anticipate elections can only occur with the approval of a large majority of Congress (three-fifths) or Temer and Rousseff resign simultaneously, that would be unlikely. Otherwise, both could be removed from their offices, depending on the outcome of a lawsuit filed in Superior Electoral Court by the PSDB, party of AeÌcio Neves, then defeated candidate in the presidential elections of 2014, claiming that there was electoral crime in the political campaign of the alliance Rousseff-Temer, with donations made by companies investigated in the Operation Car Wash. In the poll, 12% were undecided or not answered. Were heard 1,200 people in 72 Brazilian municipalities. The margin of error was 3 percentage points..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to the pt [National Confederation of Industry], the industry confidence index reached 47.3 points on July 2016, from 45.7 in June, 10.1 points higher than July 2015. According to Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the pt [National Index of Consumer Prices Broad] in Brazil decreased from 0.78% in May 2016 to 0.35% in June 2016, the lowest index since August 2015..\\\\c\\\\cCompleted the phases of appreciation and admissibility of the impeachment process, the subsequent procedure requires new citations, instruction with gathering of evidences and witness testimonies to support the decision. The Senate, in a plenary session, pronounce by a simple majority if the charges are well-founded or not to the decisive judgment. The first task is Rousseff notification to allow a new defence. For this whole second phase of the process, the Committee is supported by the president of Supreme Federal Court, Ricardo Lewandowski. The last phase of the trial, that decided by the conviction or acquittal of the withdrawn President, is chaired by Lewandowski, on the condition of Supreme Court president. On this decisive voting, two-thirds of the votes (54 of the total of 81 senators) are needed to permanently remove the President..\\\\c\\\\c1 June 2016 completed the 20-day period to suspended President Dilma Rousseff formalize a previous defence for the trial in the Senate. The document was personally registered on Senate by Rousseff\\\\s lawyer, former Minister of Justice and former General\\\\s Office attorney JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo..\\\\c\\\\cIn the 370-page document, besides the reasons already claimed on the previous phase, that the president has not committed the alleged crimes of responsibility, it is stated that the just cause or reason aimed at the need for consummation of Rousseff\\\\s impeachment was only and exclusively the aim at end up the Operation Car Wash. For this statement, Cardozo was supported by the transcripts of an occultly recorded conversation among pt [SeÌrgio Machado (politician and businessman)], former president of Transpetro (a Petrobras subsidiary), and the senator Romero JucaÌ, a politician with influential leadership in the Brazilian party PMDB, published by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. In the concept of Cardozo, the dialogue indicated that they were trying to obstruct the investigation sprawling, due to the risk of both be caught up and suggest that Rousseff\\\\s impeachment could have been part of an agreement aiming to prevent and possibly even cease the investigations in the Operation Car Wash. Otherwise, the lawyer of senator JucaÌ said that his client never thought to perform any interference in the Operation Car Wash and the dialogue does not suggest that..\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 May 2016, the senator Antonio Anastasia, rapporteur of the Special Committee of Impeachment 2016 (CEI 2016), presented the work plan for the trial. Workers Party senators complained about the haste to adjudicate. The Committee\\\\s president Raimundo Lira accepted the request and the next meeting was scheduled to 2 June, for analysis of new deadlines..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 June 2016, the Committee has appreciated the report with new work plan deadlines presented by the rapporteur Anastasia and requests by senators. The session, that lasted over nine hours, was attended by Roussef\\\\s lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo. Anastasia has proposed by 7 July the final arguments of the prosecution and the defence. Once, the Worker Party senators disagreed with deadlines and decided that they would presented a new revision of the deadlines for analisys of the president of Court, Ricardo Levandowsy. Anastasia also rejected to append in process, the recording of the conversation among SeÌrgio Machado and the senator Romero JucaÌ, required by Cardozo. In his understanding, it would be irrelevant to the process, since that the charges against Roussef were fiscal responsibility crimes and the recording was only an informal conversation and nothing could proved legally. Cardozo protested against the decision, claiming that the facts cited in the record were a main object of the investigation. The report was voted and approved just at 20h40. Earlier, the Workers Party senators and the attorney Cardozo withdrew from the meeting, after accusing the Committee\\\\s president Lira to lessen the rights of defence. Cardozo has announced on 3 June, that would submit appeals of that decisions to president of Supeme Court, Lewandowski..\\\\c\\\\cOn 6 June, the Committee approved the work plan and deadlines presented by the rapporteur Anastasia..\\\\c\\\\cOn 7 June, Lewandowski denied the appeal filed by Cardozo to append the recording of SeÌrgio Machado, supported by a previous manifestation of the Court, that evidences collected in this kind of testimony are sheltered by confidentiality until the beginning of a formal investigation. SeÌrgio Machado was arrested and introduced the recording of the conversation during his interrogatory. Besides, the subject under appeal had been discussed in prior decisions of the Court. Lewandowski also denied another appeal of senator Aloysio Nunes, former member of the Committee, to reduce the number of witnesses. On 2 June meeting, the Committee established that would be heard eight witnesses for each fact aimed against Rousseff, both for the prosecution and for the defence, i.e. a total of 48 witnesses for each side, with each supplemental budget decree that motivated the request for impeachment, considered separately. Lewandowski held that the Commission\\\\s decision should respect the right to legal defence. Nunes intended that the six decrees were as a unique fact, to be added to the so-called tax pedaling, which should considered another fact, so that the number of witnesses to be heard could be reduced to 16..\\\\c\\\\cThereafter, on 8 June meeting, the Committee accepted a request of both, defence and prosecution, reducing to four the number of supplemental budget decrees to be considered in the trial, as crime of responsibility by President Rousseff. Thus, the number of witnesses in the process was also reduced to forty. Since each charge entitle eight witnesses, the defence of Rousseff could introduce up to 32 witnesses for the four decrees and eight for the tax pedaling charge. The prosecution would be entitled the same number of witnesses. The decision to reduce the charges was supported on a report produced at the course on the House of Representatives, that considered two decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress were neutral from fiscal perspective, once the primary sources and financial expenses listed in these documents were equivalent..\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 June began the witnesses hearings, beginning with the convened by prosecution. Rousseff\\\\s lawyer Jose Eduardo Cardozo and prosecutors JanaiÌna Paschoal and Miguel Reale Junior also attended the meeting. Four witnesses, indicated by the authors of the impeachment request, were heard in the meeting, that lasted over 14 hours, from 11h40 to 2h10 on 9 June: the procurator of the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, the auditor of TCU, Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho, the Credit Operations manager of the pt [National Treasury Secretary], Adriano Pereira de Paula, and the deputy secretary of the National Treasury, Otavio Ladeira de Medeiros..\\\\c\\\\cFraud is the will of, free and consciously, to practice the misconduct and get the result. And that\\\\s what the President did. She edited the decrees by a free and conscious mode to increase costs, that could not increased by a decree. She should sent a bill..\\\\c\\\\cJulio Marcelo de Oliveira said that in April 2015, TCU has identified the recidivist fiscal misconduct, so-called tax pedaling, immediately rejected. There was not previous understanding to modified the rules and the consensus, every time that the TCU has ruled, was disapproved this conduct adopted illegally by Rousseff. He also reiterated that the President acted intentionally to borrow from public banks, that acted coercively in these operations. This, in his opinion, is serious, and forbidden by the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law]. The practice, he said, lasted years, including throughout the year 2015..\\\\c\\\\cThe auditor of TCU, Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho said that the fiscal practices by Rousseff were unprecedented. He also reiterated that the misconducts committed has caused serious outcomes..\\\\c\\\\cOn 9 and 10 June there were no Committee meetings. From 13 to 17 June, there were five meetings, with hearings of sixteen witnesses, two by prosecution and fourteen by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 13 June, were heard the prosecution witnesses Tiago Alves de Gouveia Lins Dutra and Leonardo Rodrigues Albernaz, both TCU auditors. Tiago Dutra said that Rousseff held credit operations with public banks in 2015 that had already observed in 2014. A TCU report pointed a delay of eleven months in the amount of R$2.6 billion, and five months in transfers of R$3 billion, related to the operations. For principal and interest, until December 2015, the government have been paid R$15 billion, of which R$2 billion were related to interest. According Leonardo Albernaz, more than fifty auditors accomplished an analysis of Rousseff accounts and concluded unanimously that her administration has made the most reckless management of public finances since the Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted in May 2000..\\\\c\\\\cThe Committeeâs President, Raimundo Lira, announced the decision of the President of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski, authorizing an audit in the documents, requested by the defence. Lira designated a board consisting of three experts, granting to prosecution, defence and the Senators 48 hours to formulate questions and indicate technical assistants, as well as 24 hours to refute the appointed experts, fixing also a ten days deadline for the completion of audit..\\\\c\\\\cI don\\\\t understand that it was a credit operation, but a rendering of services. At no time that the Union pays to bank was directly related to what the producers has received. The producers received from the bank itself. The Union participation doesn\\\\t characterize a credit operation between the Union and public banks..\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 June, were heard the first witnesses convened by defence, the former National Secretary of Planning and Strategic Investment, Gilson Bittencourt, and the former Secretary of Agricultural Policy of the Ministry of Agriculture, AndreÌ Nassar. Bittencourt said that there was no credit operation between the Union and public banks and also denied that there was delay in the payment of interest to public banks in 2015. According Bittencourt, the debit to be paid in 2016 came to be due only at the time of collection by the banks, that is done every six months. AndreÌ Nassar said that the Bank of Brazil had interest in to circulate money, by lend to producers, even getting the transfers delayed by the government. He also said that, as Secretary of Agricultural Policy and from the point of view of the agricultural sector, this was the most important to avoid a discontinuity that, if had occurred, would generated serious outcomes to the sector..\\\\c\\\\cOn 15 June, were heard three witnesses convened by defence, the former Deputy Secretary of the Federal Budget Office, Cilair Rodrigues de Abreu, the former Secretary of Budget and Administration of the Ministry of Social Security, JoseÌ Geraldo FrancÌ§a Diniz and the Juridical Consultant of the Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management, Walter Baere de ArauÌjo Filho. Cilair Rodrigues said that the understanding of the TCU before 2015 was ever that the future target could be used by Secretary of Budget in the publication of their reports. This understanding has changed, he said, only on 2015. FrancÌ§a Diniz commented that, due the process complexity for supplemental budget decrees, the documents are reviewed by experts and the President could not accomplish a whole analysis of the documents. Rousseff signed, but it would impossible to analyse in details 200 pages of attachments, calculations and spreadsheets. Walter Baere said that the TCU never emitted formal advices concerning the illegality of the issue of supplemental budget decrees by the President. He said also that the TCU has the specific legal duty to alert when there is a possibility of not achieving the fiscal targets..\\\\c\\\\cOn 16 June, were heard four witnesses convened by defence, the former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Education, pt [Luiz ClaÌudio Costa], the former Secretary Executive Assistant of the Ministry of Education, Wagner Vilas Boas, the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Education, Iara Ferreira Pinho and the Director of the Department of Economic Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Clayton Luiz Montes.According to Luiz Claudio Costa, the supplemental budget decree for the Ministry of Education, was important for the management, enabling several sectors linked to the Ministry, such as universities, institutes and others, should adequate their budget to the instant needs. Vilas Boas explained that it was not granting of the Ministry of Education to evaluate the impact of the credit opening for obtaining the primary balance target. He said that the sectorial authority - in this case the agencies of the Ministry - make a request for supplemental budget, but are liable to policy guidance and technical supervision by the budget agency. Both, Wagner Vilas Boas and Iara Pinho, said they could not give an opinion on the compatibility of the signed supplementary decrees and the current fiscal target since their functions donât allow to accomplish analysis of the achievement of the target. Concerning these statements, the prosecution pointed out that the technicians were not able to explain specifically about the possible crime of responsibility. The witnesses left shown that unaware the facts. Our claim is that the evidence shall excusedâ, said prosecution lawyer, Janaina Paschoal, after the testimony of Iara Pinho..\\\\c\\\\cClayton Luiz Montes said that âthe government has followed the new understanding of the TCU by October 2015. Since that time, were not sent any credit decreesâ. This, nevertheless, is conflicting with the statements of TCU auditors, that there was not previous understanding to modified the rules..\\\\c\\\\cOn 17 June, were heard five witnesses convened by defence, the former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management, Nelson Barbosa, the former Minister of Education, pt [JoseÌ Henrique Paim], the Director of the Department of Infrastructure Programs of the Federal Budget Secretary,  Zarak de Oliveira Ferreira, the  Analyst of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management, Antonio JoseÌ Chatack Carmelo, and the Planning and Budget Analyst of the Federal Budget Office, Georgimar Martiniano de Sousa..\\\\c\\\\cNelson Barbosa said that the additional credit decrees issued by President Rousseff from June to August 2015 not prevented the fulfilment of the fiscal target approved by Congress in early 2015 and, since is an supplemental credit that has no impact on the target, was not considered a target of primary balance, but to give more autonomy to the allocation of a value already available. Henrique Paim said that the decrees were essential to the functioning of various sectors of Education, including scientific research and operation of universities. Moreover, according to the former minister, the additional credits are often edited based on revenue generation, provided by budget units, linked to the Ministry. Also the technicians Zarak de Oliveira, Chatack Carmelo and Georgimar Martiniano, have not seen incompatibility of supplemental decrees with the fiscal target..\\\\c\\\\cFrom 20 to 24 June, there were five meetings, with hearings of fifteen witnesses, all convened  by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 June, were heard four witnesses, the former Deputy Chief for Legal Affairs of Staff of the Presidency, Ivo da Motta Azevedo Correa, the former Minister of Education, Renato Janine Ribeiro, the Director of the Department of Social Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Felipe Daruich Neto and the former Deputy Executive Secretary of the Staff of the Presidency, Bruno Moretti. Ivo Correa said that an alert of the TCU is not a decision of the Court, therefore, the government relied on previous jurisprudence to edit the decrees. Janine Ribeiro said that not has received any alert of the TCU about irregularities in the supplemental budget decrees when Minister of Education. Daruich Neto saids that, at any time, as occurred any intentional misconduct and is impracticable to the President evaluate all decrees, before sign it..\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 June, were heard four witnesses, the former Minister of the pt [Secretary of Human Rights], pt [Pepe Vargas], the former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management and former President of Caixa EconoÌmica Federal, pt [Miriam Belchior], the Planning and Budget Analyst and former Deputy Secretary of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Justice, Orlando MagalhaÌes da Cunha and the Coordinator of Budget and Finance of the Ministry of Justice, Marcelo Minghelli. The former Minister Pepe Vargas asserted that the supplemental credit to Secretary of Human Rights was derived not just from Treasury resources, but of surplus resources of funds obtained through donations by individuals and corporations. Mirian Belchior said that the supplemental budget decrees, by which Rousseff is indicted were lawful and was impossible increase the resources contingency as made in 2015..\\\\c\\\\cOn 22 June, were heard three witnesses, the Planning and Budget Analyst and General Coordinator of Technology and Information of the Federal Budget Office, Robson Azevedo Rung, the Secretary of Institutional Organization of the Ministry of Defence, Luiz Antonio de Souza Cordeiro and the Representative of the Superior Labor Court, Luciano Carlos de Almeida. Azevedo Rung said that the Federal Budget Office received a new interpretation from TCU only in 2015, concerning to procedures that ever were well settled..\\\\c\\\\cAlso on this meeting, the Committee approved a new timetable for the trial. On 6 July, testimony of Rousseff, who can be represented by her lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo. From 7 to 12 July, final arguments of the prosecution and from 13 to 27 July, final arguments of the defence. On 9 August, discussion and voting of the report in plenary and 22 August, the estimated date to decisive judgment..\\\\c\\\\cOn 23 June, were heard two witnesses, the  Deputy Secretary of Planning, Budget and Administration of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Anderson Lozi da Rocha and the former Secretary of Federal Budget, Esther Dweck. Dweck denied that the supplemental budget decrees in 2015 has contributed to the breach of the target for primary surplus for that year..\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 June, were heard two witnesses, the former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Labor and Employment, Francisco JoseÌ Pontes Ibiapina and the Director of Special Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Marcos de Oliveira Ferreira. Pontes Ibiapina said that the supplemental budget decrees were published to aid programs as the transfer of resources to States and Municipalities, by the pt [National Employment System] and other programs..\\\\c\\\\cFrom 27 to 29 June happened three meetings, with hearings of nine witnesses, all convened  by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 June, was heard pt [Patrus Ananias], former Ministry of Agrarian Development. Ananias said that he unknowledge the tax pedaling and the resources were transferred from the Bank of Brazil directly to producers with subsidized interest rates, due to the heed that agriculture deserves..\\\\c\\\\cOn 28 June, were heard pt [Maria Fernanda Ramos Coelho], former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Agrarian Development, Aldo Rebelo, former Ministry of Defence, LuiÌs InaÌcio Adams, former General\\\\s Office attorney and AntoÌnio Carlos Stangherlin Rebelo, technical responsible for analysis of supplemental credits on the National Justice Council.Maria Fernanda said that the delay in the payment of interest rate equalization of the Plan Safra (government\\\\s plan to support agriculture) for 2015, does not configure a credit operation, since the noncompliance was not subject to penalty payment in the contract term. According to former secretary, the values were only monetarily adjusted. The prosecution lawyer pt [JanaiÌna Paschoal] rejected the claims of Maria Fernanda and said that the remuneration per pt [interest rate SELIC] (a benchmark interest rate of the Brazilian economy) is a proof that there was a credit operation. The prosecution reiterates that this statement confirmed the infringement materiality, she concluded. Aldo Rebelo rejected the accusations that the government spent wantonly in 2015, and that year was characterized by fiscal adjustments and efforts to reduce the public spending..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 June, were heard JoaÌo Luiz Guadagnin, Director of the Department of Finance and Production Protection of the Ministry of Agrarian Development, Marcel Mascarenhas dos Santos, Prosecutor of the Central Bank, Fernando Rocha, Deputy Head of the Economic Department of the Central Bank, and Paulo JoseÌ dos Reis Souza, Finance and Control Analyst and Fiscal Policy Secretary on the pt [National Treasury Secretary]..\\\\c\\\\cThe phase of witnesses hearings had concluded on 29 June. A total of 44 witnesses were heard, six convened by prosecution and 38 by defence..\\\\c\\\\cAt the end of the witnesses hearings phase, both the prosecution and the defence lawyers said they were confident about their theses. The prosecution lawyer, Janaina Paschoal, criticized the actions of Rousseff\\\\s defense due the great number of witnesses convened, with clear dilatory intention, and the most of witnesses unknows accurately the facts. The defence lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo also expressed confidence, but said that the process has a political nature and this may interfere in the result. He also pointed out that some senators refused to discuss with the witnesses, because they were already a judgment before the completion of work..\\\\c\\\\cOn 5 July 2016, was heard the board of experts designated by the Committeeâs President, Raimundo Lira on 13 June 2016 meeting, to accomplish an audit in the documents, requested by the defence, and authorized  by the President of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski.The board, composed by the auditors JoaÌo Henrique Pederiva, Prandino Diego Alves and Fernando Alvaro LeaÌo Rincon, submitted the audit report results. According them, the delays in the transfer of payments to the public banks constituted loans. However, they avoided consider whether there was intent of the President and said that this judgment will be up to senators. After, were also heard the assistant by prosecution, Selene PeÌres Nunes and the assistant by defense, Ricardo Lodi Ribeiro. Selene Nunes pointed out that there was willful misconduct by the President, since the operations were hidden by accounting and, later, the government has issued a pt [provisional measure] allowing the payment of debts. The assistant by defense, Ricardo Ribeiro, said that the President has no responsibility for the issue of the supplemental budget decrees because they were submitted to her signature by the technical areas of the ministries and her participation, as demonstrated in the report, was only the signing of these decrees..\\\\c\\\\cOn 6 July, would be carried out a Rousseff\\\\s interrogatory, however she declined to attend the Committee and sent a letter, read entirely by Cardozo. Rousseff defended herself, claiming that she was a victim of a conspiracy, repeating the arguments that have been mentioned from the process beginning. The final arguments by prosecution were delivered to Committee on 12 July, and the final arguments by defense were delivered to Committee on 28 July, for preparation of the final report by rapporteur, Antonio Anastasia..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 August, Anastasia submitted the final report, concluding by Rousseff\\\\s culpability. On 3 August, the document was discussed by the Committee. JoaÌo Correia Serra, prosecution lawyer in lieu, praised Anastasia\\\\s report and stressed the known centralizing temperament of Rousseff, that reinforces the impossibility of the withdrawn President not being aware or not directly commanded the acts for which she was accused. Otherwise, Cardozo said that he was sure that Anastasia\\\\s report does not evinced that Rousseff has committed crimes, and accused the rapporteur, despite his aptitude and usual brilliance, managed his actions within the opinion of his party. On 4 August, the report was voted and approved by 14-5 vote, closing the work of the Committee and following for voting in the Senate floor on 9 August, chaired by Ricardo Lewandowski, Supreme Federal Court president..\\\\c\\\\cIn a long section, started at 9:40 am on 9 August and lasted over sixteen hours, the Senate floor approved on early morning of 10 August, the final report of Anastasia. By 59-21 vote, the indictments against Dilma Rousseff had upheld, ending the penultimate phase of the process, called pronunciation and determining the final judgment in the Senate, beginning on 25 August. In this judgment, two-thirds of 81 senators are necessary to remove the President from office and make her ineligible for office, for eight years subsequent to 1 January 2019, when her second term would end..\\\\c\\\\cThe last phase of the trial has three steps:.\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 August, began the witnesses inquiries, in a stired section, that lasted over fifteen hours. By prosecution, had convened two witnesses, Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, procurator of the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), author of the report recommending the rejection of 2014 accounts, and Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho JuÌnior, auditor of TCU. Oliveira was inquired as informant and not witness, as decided by Lewandowski, after Cardozo accused him that made its report based in a biased understanding. Oliveira refused, claiming that only fulfilled a recommendation to adopt a less tolerant rule came from TCU. Oliveira reiterated that Rousseff broke budget laws in 2014 and also in 2015. In the condition of informant, Oliveira complaints cannot be considered as evidence for the process, but as technical information. The next prosecution witness inquired, D\\\\Avila Carvalho, reiterates that Rousseff disguised the accounting and was responsible for delaying transfers to state banks. Cardozo also tried to desqualify D\\\\Avila as witness, accusing him of biased conduct, because he helped the prosecutor Oliveira to draft the TCU report. Cardozo pleaded that was a clearly an unethical situation that violates the principle of impartiality. However, Lewandowski denied the request..\\\\c\\\\cThe inquiries continued on 26 and 27 August. Six witness were convened by defence: pt [Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo], economist, Geraldo Luiz Mascarenhas Prado, legal advisor, pt [Luiz ClaÌudio Costa], Ministry of Education, Nelson Barbosa, former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management, Esther Dweck, former Secretary of Federal Budget and Ricardo Ribeiro Lodi, Law professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. Dweck was dispensed by Lewandowski, since there would be a conflict of interest, once she was being contracted for the office of Gleisi Hoffmann, one of the senators opposed to impeachment. Gonzaga Belluzzo  and Ribeiro Lodi were heard in the condition of informant..\\\\c\\\\cBelluzo said that interruption of a mandate achieved by universal suffrage is something that should require very special care. It could only be done in extreme situations, and that trial had not facing it..\\\\c\\\\cFor Mascarenhas Prado, by signing the decrees, the President acted in reliance on the advice of his subordinates, which attested to the legality of acts. As for ClaÌudio Costa, the supplementary credit decrees were used in educational programs. The senador CaÌssio Cunha Lima refused, saying that crime is not the expansion of universities and technical schools, but the lack of Congress authorization for such decrees..\\\\c\\\\cNelson Barbosa said that decrees provides more leeway to the administration of funds, when the budget is limited, and are edited by experienced officials. Pro-impeachment senators insisted that those actions have aggravated the economic crisis that facing the country. Barbosa said that the crisis was due to various internal and external factors. At last, Ribeiro Lodi stated that the decrees issued by the President in July and August 2015 were not considered violations until then by TCU and at that moment, when the decrees were issued, this understanding did not exist..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 August, Rousseff attended the Senate, to defend herself..\\\\c\\\\c(CNN) Brazil\\\\s first female president is out of a job, but not barred from the ballot if she wants to run again. The South American country\\\\s Senate voted 61-20 Wednesday to remove President Dilma Rousseff from office, finding her guilty of breaking budgetary laws in an impeachment trial. Temer, 75, inherits a tattered economy, along with the keys to the presidential palace in Brasilia, the nation\\\\s capital. He met with his Cabinet and promised to tackle unemployment.

The Senate\\\\s decision is a major blow for Rousseff, a member of the Workers\\\\ Party, but it might not mark the end of her political career. While the vote to oust her from office was decisive, a motion to bar her from holding any public office for the next eight years failed.

It began because 90% of the population has said loudly, no more (Workers\\\\ Party), he said.

When Brazil or when a president is impeached for a crime that they have not committed, the name we have for this in democracy -- it\\\\s not an impeachment, it is a coup, she said after the Senate voted to launch the proceedings. The heir-apparent to former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Rousseff was re-elected by a narrow margin in 2014, but a recession and a cross-party corruption scandal put an end to any political goodwill she might have earned, eventually leading to her ouster.

Relations between the United States and the Philippines have historically been strong and have been been described as a Special Relationship.[citation needed]The United States is the Philippines\\\\ closest ally in the world,[citation needed] the Philippines being one of the oldest Asian partners of the U.S. and a strategic major non-NATO ally. The United States has consistently been cited as one of the Filipinos\\\\ favorite nations in the world, with 90% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and 91% viewing Americans favorably in 2002, 90% of Filipinos viewing U.S. influence positively in 2011, 85% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and Americans favorably in 2013, and 92% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. favorably in 2015, and 89% having confidence in United States president, Barack Obama in 2014, making the Philippines the most pro-American country in the world..\\\\c\\\\cThis article discusses PhilippineâAmerican relations after Philippine independence from the United States in 1946, while the article History of the Philippines (1898â1946) describes the history of the Philippines during American colonial rule..\\\\c\\\\cPursuant to the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the United States maintained and operated major facilities at Clark Air Base until November 1991, and at Subic Bay Naval Complex and several small subsidiary installations in the Philippines until November 1992. In July 1991, negotiators from the two countries reached agreement on a draft treaty providing for the clean-up and turn over of Clark to the Philippine government in 1992, and for the lease of Subic Bay Naval Base by the U.S. for ten years. By 1991, operations at Clark had already been scaled back because of the end of the Cold War, with the last combat aircraft leaving in 1990, before the base was heavily damaged by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo..\\\\c\\\\cOn September 16, 1991, the Philippine Senate rejected the bases treaty by a slim margin, and despite further efforts to salvage the situation, the two sides could not reach an agreement. As a result, the Philippine Government informed the U.S. on December 6, 1991, that it would have one year to complete withdrawal. That withdrawal went smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule, with the last U.S. forces departing on November 24, 1992. On departure, the U.S. Government turned over assets worth more than $1.3 billion to the Philippines, including an airport and ship-repair facility. Agencies formed by the Philippine Government have converted the former military bases for civilian commercial use, with Subic Bay serving as a flagship for that effort. The Philippine government on July 16, 2015 announced that it will revive a US-built deep-water naval base in Subic Bay..\\\\c\\\\cThe post-U.S. bases era has seen U.S.-Philippine relations improved and broadened, with a prominent focus on economic and commercial ties while maintaining the importance of the security dimension. U.S. investment continues to play an important role in the Philippine economy, while a strong security relationship rests on the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). In February 1998, U.S. and Philippine negotiators concluded the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), paving the way for increased military cooperation under the MDT. The agreement was approved by the Philippine Senate in May 1999 and entered into force on June 1, 1999. Under the VFA, the U.S. has conducted ship visits to Philippine ports and has resumed large combined military exercises with Philippine forces. Key events in the bilateral relationship include the July 4, 1996 declaration by President Ramos of Philippine-American Friendship Day in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Philippine independence. Ramos visited the U.S. in April 1998, and then-President Estrada visited in July 2000. President Arroyo met with President Bush in an official working visit in November 2001 and made a state visit in Washington on May 19, 2003. President Bush made a state visit to the Philippines on October 18, 2003, during which he addressed a joint session of the Philippine Congressâthe first American President to do so since Dwight D. Eisenhower. There are regular U.S. cabinet-level and congressional visits to the Philippines as well..\\\\c\\\\cPresident Arroyo repeatedly stressed the close friendship between the Philippines and the U.S. and her desire to expand bilateral ties further. Both governments tried to revitalize and strengthen their partnership by working toward greater security, prosperity, and service to Filipinos and Americans alike. Inaugurated into office on the same day as President Bush, President Arroyo lent strong support to the Global War on Terrorism. In October 2003, the U.S. designated the Philippines as a Major non-NATO ally. That same month, the Philippines joined the select group of countries to have ratified all 12 UN counterterrorism conventions..\\\\c\\\\cThe annual Balikatan (Shoulder-to-Shoulder) bilateral military exercises contribute directly to the Philippine armed forces\\\\ efforts to root out Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah terrorists and bring development to formerly terrorist-plagued areas, notably Basilan and Jolo. They include not only combined military training but also civil-military affairs and humanitarian projects. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program is the largest in the Pacific and the third-largest in the world, and a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) was signed in November 2002. Similarly, law enforcement cooperation has reached new levels: U.S. and Philippine agencies have cooperated to bring charges against numerous terrorists, to implement the countries\\\\ extradition treaty, and to train thousands of Filipino law enforcement officers. There is a Senior Law Enforcement Advisor helping the Philippine National Police with its Transformation Program..\\\\c\\\\cThe U.S. works closely with the Philippines to reduce poverty and increase prosperity. The U.S. fully supports Philippine efforts to root out corruption, to open economic opportunity, and to invest in health and education. USAID programs support the \\\\Philippines\\\\ war on poverty as well as the government\\\\s reform agenda in critical areas, including anti-money laundering, rule of law, tax collection, and trade and investment. Other USAID programs have bolstered the government\\\\s efforts to heal divisions in Philippine society through a focus on conflict resolution, livelihood enhancement for former combatants, and economic development in Mindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, among the poorest areas in the country. Meanwhile, important programs continue in modern family planning, infectious disease control, environmental protection, rural electrification, and provision of basic servicesâas well as PL 480 food aid programs and others, which together totaled $211.3 million. In 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation granted $21 million to the Philippines for a threshold program addressing corruption in revenue administration..\\\\c\\\\cNearly 400,000 Americans visit the Philippines each year. Providing government services to U.S. and other citizens, therefore, constitutes an important aspect of the bilateral relationship. Those services include veterans\\\\ affairs, social security, and consular operations. Benefits to Filipinos from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration totaled $297,389,415 in 2006. Many people-to-people programs exist between the U.S. and the Philippines, including Fulbright, International Visitors, and Aquino Fellowship exchange programs, as well as the U.S. Peace Corps..\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2014, a ten-year pact Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was signed between the U.S. President Barack Obama and the Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines..\\\\c\\\\cTwo-way U.S. merchandise trade with the Philippines amounted to $17.3 billion in 2006 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). According to Philippine Government data, 16% of the Philippines\\\\ imports in 2006 came from the U.S., and about 18% of its exports were bound for America. The Philippines ranks as the 26th-largest export market and the 30th-largest supplier of the United States. Key exports to the U.S. are semiconductor devices and computer peripherals, automobile parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, wheat and animal feeds, and coconut oil. In addition to other goods, the Philippines imports raw and semi-processed materials for the manufacture of semiconductors, electronics and electrical machinery, transport equipment, and cereals and cereal preparations..\\\\c\\\\cThe U.S. traditionally has been the Philippines\\\\ largest foreign investor, with about $6.6 billion in estimated investment as of end-2005 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). Since the late 1980s, the Philippines has committed itself to reforms that encourage foreign investment as a basis for economic development, subject to certain guidelines and restrictions in specified areas. Under President Ramos, the Philippines expanded reforms, opening the power generation and telecommunications sectors to foreign investment, as well as securing ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement and membership in the World Trade Organization. As noted earlier, President Arroyo\\\\s administration has generally continued such reforms despite opposition from vested interests and nationalist blocs. A major obstacle has been and will continue to be constitutional restrictions on, among others, foreign ownership of land and public utilities, which limits maximum ownership to 40%..\\\\c\\\\cOver the last two decades, the relatively closed Philippine economy has been opened significantly by foreign exchange deregulation, foreign investment and banking liberalization, tariff and market barrier reduction, and foreign entry into the retail trade sector. The Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 opened opportunities for U.S. firms to participate in the power industry in the Philippines. Information and communications technologies, backroom operations such as call centers, and regional facilities or shared-service centers are likewise leading investment opportunities..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the visit by President Benigno Aquino III to Washington DC, on July 7, 2012, the US-Philippine Society was launched. It is a non-profit independent organisation tasked for generating awareness about the Philippines in the US. The last board meeting was conducted by the society on January 24, 2013..\\\\c\\\\cIn its 2013 Special 301 Report, the Office of the United States Trade Representatives wrote The United States looks to the Philippines to take important steps to address piracy over the internet, in particular with respect to notorious online markets. It is speculated that pressure from the United States contributed to the complaint filed by Philippine Association of the Record Industry against the torrent website KickassTorrents, resulting in its seizure by Philippine authorities on June 13, 2013..\\\\c\\\\cU.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt M. Campbell said in January 2011 that the United States will help boost the capacity of the Philippines to patrol their own waters, including the Spratly islands..\\\\c\\\\cThe 1951 mutual-defense treaty was reaffirmed with the November 2011 Manila Declaration. United States Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert suggested that LCS or surveillance aircraft may be deployed to the Philippines. And the Philippines is considering the proposal. These rotational deployments will help replace some of the American presence in the area that was given up when the permanent American bases in the Philippines were closed under President Bush..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2012 the Philippines and the United States conducted joint military exercises. As of 2012, a U.S. military contingent of 600, including Navy Seals and Seabees are stationed indefinitely in the Southern Philippines, in a declared non-combatant role to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in operations against the al-Quaida-linked Abu Sayyaf terrorist group primarily on the island of Basilan in western Mindanao and the Sulu islands, in particular Jolo, a long-time stronghold of Abu Sayyaf..\\\\c\\\\cThe Scarborough Shoal standoff with China and the ongoing Spratly islands dispute has caused the Philippines to consider stronger military ties with the United States. In 2012, a senior Philippine defense official said that as long as they have prior clearance from the Philippine government, American troops, warships and aircraft could once again use their former naval and air facilities of Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base. In 2013, Foreign Secretary, Albert del Rosario clarified that, due to constitutional constraints, establishment of a US military facility could only be allowed if it would be under the control of the Philippine military. The deal will reportedly include shared access to Philippines military but not civilian facilities..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a 2013 visit to the Philippines, Deputy Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter said that the main security issues that the USA was working with the Philippines  were:.\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2014, a ten-year pact (EDCA â Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement) was signed between the U.S. President, Barack Obama and the Philippine President, Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines..\\\\c\\\\cThe U.S. maintains an embassy in Manila and a consulate in Cebu. The American Business Center, which houses the Foreign Commercial Service and the Foreign Agricultural Service, is located in Makati City.  The Philippine government maintains an embassy in Washington, D.C. as well as several consulates throughout the United States..\\\\c\\\\cStory highlights Obama was to meet with the South Korean President instead Duterte says he is not answerable to anyone except the Filipino people Vientiane, Laos (CNN) Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte is expressing regret after his obscenity-laden rant against President Barack Obama prompted the White House to cancel planned bilateral talks between the two leaders.

This season began nearly five months before the official start, with Hurricane Alex forming in the Northeastern Atlantic in mid-January. Tropical Storm Bonnie followed in late May, which was the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012. In June, tropical storms Colin and Danielle formed and became the earliest third and fourth named storms in the Atlantic in recorded history. In August, Hurricane Earl killed 67 people after striking Belize and Mexico..\\\\c\\\\cTo this point, most forecasting groups have expected this season to be an above average season, due to a combination of factors including an expected transition to La NinÌa and warmer than normal sea surface temperatures in the Gulf of Mexico, Caribbean, and Western Atlantic, despite near-average sea surface temperatures in the Atlantic Main Development Region near Cape Verde. So far, six of the eight developed storms have impacted land, and 5 of those storms caused loss of life, directly or indirectly..\\\\c\\\\cAhead of and during the season, several national meteorological services and scientific agencies forecast how many named storms, hurricanes and major hurricanes will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. These agencies include the Tropical Storm Risk (TSR) Consortium of the University College London, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) and Colorado State University (CSU). The forecasts include weekly and monthly changes in significant factors that help determine the number of tropical storms, hurricanes, and major hurricanes within a particular year. Some of these forecasts also take into consideration what happened in previous seasons and the predicted weakening of the 2014â16 El NinÌo event. On average, an Atlantic hurricane season between 1981 and 2010 contained twelve tropical storms, six hurricanes, two major hurricanes, and an accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) index of 66â103 units..\\\\c\\\\cThe first forecast for the year was issued by CSU on December 10, who anticipated that one of four different scenarios could occur. TSR subsequently issued their first outlook for the 2016 season during December 16, 2015 and predicted that activity would be about 20% below the 1950â2015 average, or about 15% below the 2005â2015 average. Specifically they thought that there would be 13 tropical storms, 5 hurricanes, 2 major hurricanes and an ACE index of 79 units. A few months later, TSR issued their second prediction for the season during April 6, 2016 and lowered the predicted number of named storms to 12 but raised the number of hurricanes to 6.  On April 14, CSU predicted that the season would be near-normal, predicting 13 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes with ACE near 93. On April 15, North Carolina State University predicted the season would be very active, with 15-18 named storms, 8-11 hurricanes and 3-5 major hurricanes. A month later, the United Kingdom Met Office (UKMO) released its forecast, predicting a slightly above-average season with 14 named storms and 8 hurricanes. It also predicted  an ACE index of 125, above the defined average ACE index at 103. On May 27, NOAA issued its first outlook calling for a near-normal season with a 70% chance that 10-16 named storms could form, including 4-8 hurricanes of which 1-4 could reach major hurricane status. NOAA also stated that there is a 45% chance of a near-normal season, 30% chance of an above-normal season and 25% chance of a below-normal season. Also on May 27, TSR substantially increased their forecast numbers, predicting activity would be about 30% above the average with 17 named storms, 9 hurricanes, 4 major hurricanes and an ACE near 130. The reason for the increased activity forecast was the increased likelihood of La NinÌa forming during the season in addition to a trend towards a negative North Atlantic Oscillation, which generally favors a warmer tropical Atlantic. TSR predicted that there is a 57% chance that the 2016 Atlantic season would be above-normal, a 33% chance it would be near-normal, and only a 10% chance it would be below-normal..\\\\c\\\\cCSU updated their forecast on June 1 to include 14 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes to include recently formed Tropical Storm Bonnie. It was again updated on July 1 to include 15 named storms, 6 hurricanes and 2 major hurricanes, to accommodate for tropical storms Colin and Danielle. On July 5, TSR released their fourth forecast for the season, slightly lowering the predicted numbers to 16 tropical storms, 8 hurricanes and 3 major hurricanes. On August 5, TSR released their final forecast for the season, lowering the numbers to 15 named storms and 7 hurricanes due to the influence that La NinÌa being less than anticipated previously..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 13, an extratropical cyclone over the eastern Atlantic Ocean developed into a subtropical storm. Assigned the name Alex, the system soon developed into a fully tropical hurricaneâthe first such storm in January since Alice in 1955. Alex then made landfall over Terceira Island, Azores, as a strong tropical storm, before becoming extratropical on January 15. The next tropical cyclone developed in late May, originating as a tropical depression on May 27. The next day, the depression developed into Tropical Storm Bonnie, the first occurrence of two pre-season Atlantic storms since 2012 and the third occurrence since 1951. Bonnie drifted north-northwestwards over the following day, before weakening back into a depression early on May 29, however its remnant low regenerated into a tropical storm a few days later and finally dissipated north of Bermuda on June 5. Simultaneously, a new tropical depression developed near the YucataÌn Peninsula. This depression soon became Tropical Storm Colin on June 5, marking the earliest occurrence of a seasons third named storm since reliable records began, surpassing the previous record set in 1887. On June 20, when Danielle had strengthened into a tropical storm, it also marked the earliest fourth named storm, surpassing the previous record set by Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 by 3 days. However, after Danielle, activity halted as no storms formed in July, an occurrence not seen since 2012. Activity resumed once again with the formation of Hurricane Earl, Tropical Storm Fiona, Hurricane Gaston, and Tropical Depression Eight in the month of August..\\\\c\\\\cThe Accumulated Cyclone Energy (ACE) index for the 2016 Atlantic hurricane season, as of 09:00 UTC on August 28, is 18.9925 units..\\\\c\\\\cOn January 7, the National Hurricane Center noted the potential for an extratropical low about 425 mi (685 km) west-southwest of Bermuda to gain subtropical or tropical characteristics over subsequent days, as it tracked across the central Atlantic. Convection began to coalesce near the center of the low on January 13, leading to the formation of Subtropical Storm Alex about 785 miles (1,260 km) south-southwest of the Azores, at 21:00 UTC. Alex is the first tropical or subtropical storm to form in January since 1978, and only the fourth known tropical or subtropical cyclone formation during the month on record. When Alex became a hurricane at 15:00 UTC on January 14, it marked only the second recorded hurricane formation in January, with the other being Hurricane One in 1938. On January 15, the NHC issued its last advisory on Hurricane Alex, as the system transitioned back into an extratropical cyclone. On January 17, Alex was absorbed by another extratropical cyclone, in the southern Labrador Sea..\\\\c\\\\cOn May 24, the NHC began monitoring an area of disturbed weather resultant from the interaction of a weakening cold front and an upper-level trough. A surface area of low pressure formed late the next day, eventually gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression at 21:00 UTC on May 27. Steered west-northwest within an only marginally conducive environment, the depression slowly intensified into Tropical Storm Bonnie a day later. The continued effects of high wind shear and dry air caused the cyclones appearance to degenerate early on May 29, and Bonnie weakened back to tropical depression strength less than an hour prior to its landfall just east of Charleston, South Carolina. The depression meandered over South Carolina for over a day before regressing to a remnant low over the northeastern portion of the state at 15:00 UTC on May 30. However, Bonnie regenerated into a tropical depression on June 2 amidst more favorable conditions. Late the next day, Bonnie re-strengthened back to a tropical storm due to a burst of convection. Bonnie then weakened to a tropical depression on June 4 and then early on June 5, Bonnie finally dissipated into a remnant low..\\\\c\\\\cUpon formation, a tropical storm warning was hoisted in South Carolina from the Savannah River to the Little River Inlet. Heavy rains associated with Bonnie led to localized flooding, prompting the South Carolina Highway Patrol to close the southbound lanes of Interstate 95 in Jasper County, South Carolina. Rip currents along the coastline of the Southeast United States led to dozens of water rescues; the body of one 20-year-old man was recovered in Brevard County, Florida, after he drowned, while the body of a 21-year-old man was recovered in New Hanover County, North Carolina, several days after he went missing. In all, Bonnie is estimated to have caused more than $640,000 (2016 USD) in structural damage..\\\\c\\\\cIn early June, a low pressure system entered the Caribbean Sea. The low remained disorganized with only isolated convection, mostly in the eastern quadrant. Convection began to wrap into the center as the storm curved northward into the Gulf of Mexico on June 3. After the low passed over the YucataÌn Peninsula on June 5, the National Hurricane Center upgraded it to Tropical Depression Three and tropical storm warnings were issued for the Big Bend region of Florida. Later that day, the depression intensified into Tropical Storm Colin, just after tropical storm watches were put in place for eastern Florida and Georgia. The formation into a tropical storm marked the earliest formation on record of the third named storm within the Atlantic basin, exceeding the previous record set in 1887 by seven days. Gradually curving northeastwards, Colin remained disorganized as it accelerated towards the coast of Florida on June 6; in their forecast discussion, the NHC noted that their uncertainty in locating the circulation center, instead taking the midpoint between two small-scale circulations. However, a strong burst of convection increased the winds to 50 mph (85 km/h). Maintaining its intensity, Colin continued accelerating to the northeast and made landfall in the Big Bend Region just after 03:00 UTC on June 7. Failing to weaken over land, Colin began undergoing extratropical transition after the increasingly ill-defined circulation moved off the coast of Georgia, and became fully extratropical hours later. It remained extratropical and intact for nearly a week before merging with another extratropical cyclone on June 14..\\\\c\\\\cMuch of Florida experienced heavy rainfall, and flash flood and tornado warnings were issued. At least three people drowned along the Florida Panhandle due to rip currents, and a fourth remains missing but is presumed dead. Damage from Colin in the Tampa Bay area totaled $10,000 (2016 USD)..\\\\c\\\\cOn June 14, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a tropical wave located in the western Caribbean Sea. Tracking steadily to the west-northwest, the disturbance slowly moved over the YucataÌn Peninsula; during that time, development was not expected due to land interaction. However, on June 18, the disturbance exited land and moved over the warm waters of the Bay of Campeche, upon which it spawned a low pressure area with a well-defined circulation center. A further increase in organization occurred the next day despite strong wind shear, prompting the NHC to upgrade the low to Tropical Depression Four. Concurrently, the Government of Mexico issued tropical storm warnings for part of the state of Veracruz. The depression continued to slowly organize, and after a reconnaissance aircraft measured gale-force winds on June 20, the NHC upgraded it to Tropical Storm Danielle. This marked the earliest formation on record of the fourth named storm within the Atlantic basin, preceding the previous record set by Tropical Storm Debby in 2012 by 3 days. Hours later, Danielle reached peak intensity with winds of 45 mph (75 km/h). Maintaining strength, Danielle made landfall north of Tuxpan just before June 21. Rapid weakening followed and Danielle dissipated by noon that same day..\\\\c\\\\cAcross much of Veracruz, officials suspended school activities and the Port of Veracruz was temporarily closed. Flooding in the Pueblo Viejo Municipality affected 1,200 families and prompted activation of public shelters. In Ciudad Madero, Tamaulipas, a homeless man drowned in a storm drain during a flash flood..\\\\c\\\\cThe NHC began monitoring a tropical wave in the central Atlantic on July 28. The disturbances rapid movement prevented development for several days until it passed Jamaica on August 2, when a reconnaissance aircraft confirmed the presence of a closed circulation; already possessing tropical storm-force winds, it was upgraded to Tropical Storm Earl. Steered generally westward by a ridge over the South United States, Earl intensified amid warm ocean temperatures and low shear, attaining hurricane intensity and peaking with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) on August 3. Earl made landfall just southwest of Belize City, Belize around 06:00 UTC on August 4. It quickly weakened over land, although it emerged over the southern Bay of Campeche the following day while still maintaining minimal tropical storm intensity. A Hurricane Hunters mission flew into Earl later on August 5, unexpectedly measuring 60 mph (95 km/h) winds. The cyclone maintained these winds up to landfall just south of Veracruz, Veracruz around 02:00 on August 6. Once inland, Earl quickly weakened and the storms circulation dissipated by 15:00 UTC..\\\\c\\\\cThe precursor to Earl brought heavy rain and gusty winds to the Lesser Antilles and Greater Antilles. Strong winds in the Dominican Republic downed a power line onto a bus, subsequently causing a fire that killed six people. A boat crash in SamanaÌ Bay killed seven people. Significant impacts were reported in Belize after Earl moved ashore as a hurricane, including downed trees and power lines, blown transformers, damaged or ripped-off roofs, coastal and inland flooding, and a significant storm surge. Landslides in Mexico following the storms second landfall resulted in an additional 54 deaths..\\\\c\\\\cLate on August 14, the NHC began monitoring a tropical wave and its associated convection off the western coast of Africa for potential development. Steered west-northwest and eventually northwest, the wave organized amid favorable atmospheric conditions, gaining sufficient organization to be declared a tropical depression by 03:00 UTC on August 17.[citation needed] Later that day, the depression strengthened into Tropical Storm Fiona. Only modest strengthening occurred during the next four days, resulting in a low peak intensity, with one-minute sustained winds of 50 mph. By August 22, Fiona had weakened back into a depression south-southeast of Bermuda. Fiona managed to move slowly to the northwest with irregular pulses of thunderstorms flaring up, but southeast of the low-level center. Eventually, increasing wind shear took its toll on the storm and it was declared a remnant low by the NHC on August 23. The remnant low then dissipated soon thereafter.[citation needed].\\\\c\\\\cOn August 18, the National Hurricane Center began monitoring a strong tropical wave that was about to move off the coast of Africa. It moved off the coast by August 20, with conditions becoming increasingly favorable for development. The low eventually was able to attain a closed circulation west of Cape Verde on August 22, and was declared Tropical Depression Seven shortly thereafter. It then strengthened into a tropical storm by August 23 and was named Gaston. On August 24, during a Hurricane Hunter mission into the storm, they found that Gaston had hurricane-force winds, so they declared it a hurricane at 12:15 AM AST. No further strengthening occurred as wind shear associated with a nearby stationary front and dry air weakened Gaston into a tropical storm only twelve hours later. Weakening continued, with Gastons winds lowering to 60 mph later that day. Through the evening hours, convection reorganized, allowing Gaston to restrengthen.[citation needed] On August 27, Gaston restrengthened back into a Category 1 hurricane with sustained winds of 85 mph. The next day, the storm intensified into a 90 mph Category 1 hurricane, and then on 15:00 UTC a Category 2 hurricane with maximum winds of 100 mph. On 21:00 UTC, Gaston was designated as a Category 3 hurricane, the first of the season..\\\\c\\\\cAs of 5:00 p.m. AST (21:00 UTC) August 28, Hurricane Gaston is located within 20 nautical miles of 30Â°48â²N 55Â°06â²W\\\\ufeff / \\\\ufeff30.8Â°N 55.1Â°W\\\\ufeff / 30.8; -55.1\\\\ufeff (Gaston), about 580 miles (935 km) east of Bermuda.

The minimum barometric pressure is 962 mbar (hPa; 28.41 inHg), and the system is moving northwest at 4 knots (5 mph; 7 km/h). Hurricane-force winds extend outward up to 25 miles (35 km) from the center and tropical-storm-force winds extend outward up to 140 miles (220 km) from the center of Gaston..\\\\c\\\\cFor latest official information, see:.\\\\c\\\\cAs of 11:00 a.m. AST (15:00 UTC) August 28, Tropical Depression Eight is located near 31Â°30â²N 70Â°00â²W\\\\ufeff / \\\\ufeff31.5Â°N 70.0Â°W\\\\ufeff / 31.5; -70.0\\\\ufeff (Eight), about 310 miles (500 km) west of Bermuda, or about 405 miles (655 km/h) southeast of Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

An impeachment request against Rousseff was accepted by Eduardo Cunha, then president of the Chamber of Deputies, on 2 December 2015. Rousseff has been charged for responsibility crimes in the execution of her duties, including administrative misconduct and disregarding the federal budget, in violation of article 85, items V and VI of the Brazilian Constitution and the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law], article 36. However, a large number of scholars and witnesses during the hearing phase of the process, stating it is not related to responsibility crimes. In course of the process, two of the six supplemental budget decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress, were considered neutral from the fiscal perspective and removed of the charges..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to the impeachment request, Rousseff was also accused of omission concerning irregularities in Petrobras that, facing serious facts investigated by Operation Car Wash while occupying the office of president of Brazil, failed to fend off the suspects. Also according to the report, the fact is aggravated by Rousseff having been president of the board of directors in the Brazilian oil company, when the investigated facts occurred, including the controversial acquisition of Pasadena Refining System, cited on page 3 of the impeachment request. According to this request, her omission would indicate criminal responsibility.  However, these charges of omission were not included in the process, since a request indicting the involvement of Rousseff in the suspicious purchase of Pasadena had archived, by the lawful impediment to investigate the President for previous act to its mandate.On August 31st of 2016, President Rousseff was removed from office by a vote of 61-20..\\\\c\\\\cAlleged graft occurred while President Rousseff was still part of the board of directors of state-owned energy company Petrobras from 2003 to 2010. One million Brazilians protested in the streets calling for Rousseff\\\\s impeachment. No evidence that Rousseff herself was involved in the scheme has been found and she has denied any prior knowledge of the graft. Further investigation found that there were various offshore accounts and collections of art that were held by those involved in the controversy..\\\\c\\\\cIn February 2014, an investigation by Brazilian Federal Police called Operation Car Wash placed Petrobras at the center of what may be the largest corruption scandal in Brazil\\\\s history. On 14 November 2014, police raids across six Brazilian states netted prominent Brazilian politicians and businessmenâincluding some Petrobras directorsâwho were placed under investigation in regards to suspicious contracts worth $22 billion..\\\\c\\\\cUnder Rousseff, the government of Brazil has also been accused of carrying out fiscal pedaling â an accounting maneuver through which the government gives the false impression that it received more money than was spent. The government failed to provide funds to public and private banks that make payments for a number of public expense programs, including social assistance programs like Bolsa FamiÌlia, forcing the banks to finance programs without receiving government compensation. The government\\\\s apparent motive was to improve its fiscal outcomes for the years 2012 to 2014. The Tribunal de Contas da UniaÌo (TCU), in a unanimous decision, considered this operation a violation of fiscal responsibility. TCU is an auxiliary of the legislative body and has no legal power; however their decision put the National Congress under pressure to begin the process of impeachment of President Rousseff..\\\\c\\\\cRousseff was reelected in the 2014 general election, winning 51.64% of the votes. The election was one of the most contentious presidential elections in the country\\\\s history. After being sworn in on the 1st of January 2015, she started her second term weakened, mainly due to the national recession that started in 2014 and allegations of corruption, which led to a 9% approval rating in a survey by Ibope held in July of that yearâthe lowest approval rating ever for the president. On 15 March 2015, several protests began, gathering hundreds of thousands of Brazilians across the country to demand the impeachment or the resignation of Rousseff, among other issues..\\\\c\\\\cBeyond the violations of the budget law, Rousseff and her government were increasingly tainted by corruption allegations. The President of the Chamber of Deputies, Eduardo Cunha, was investigated in Operation Car Wash, under allegations of receiving bribes and keeping secret Swiss bank accounts. Consequently, Cunha was in danger of losing his mandate as the Ethics Council of the Chamber moved a lawsuit against him. Rumors emerged about attempts to agreement between the Brazilian Democratic Movement Party (PMDB) and the Workers\\\\ Party (PT), in order to end this process, which he strongly denied. When the Workers\\\\ Party announced its support for the wedge term loss on the Board of Ethics, he would have accepted the request for impeachment as an instrument of blackmail..\\\\c\\\\cIn his defense, Cunha said The receipt of the complaint has clearly defined reasons, when it talks about direct participation in the conduct described in what were then budget decrees. I haven\\\\t issued and I will not issue any judgment on the accusation against the President of the Republic, even more if it\\\\s a personal matter. I\\\\m just sticking to facts typified (in the law). He also stressed that Rousseff signed six decrees with additional credits, which increased the 2015 federal spending in non-compliance with the annual budget law and without approval of the Congress..\\\\c\\\\cInconsistent and unfounded are the reasons for this request. There is no illegal act committed by me [...] I would never accept any kind of bargain, much less those that threaten the free functioning of democratic institutions in this country..\\\\c\\\\cIn turn, Rousseff denied any attempt to forge a deal to save Cunha and get rid of impeachment, as well as agreements to interfere with the Ethics Board in exchange for the approval of a pt [CPMF] (Provisional Contribution on the Movement or Transmission of Values and Credits and Financial Nature Rights), which was another great need of the government. At a news conference on 2 December, she said that she never would accept or agree with any kind of bargain..\\\\c\\\\cShe lied on national television network and this is very serious. If she had not participated directly I would not speak..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the pronouncement of the president, Cunha said Rousseff lied to the nation when she said she would not participate in any bargain and that the government had much to explain to the country. Cunha claimed he was not aware of negotiations and that he had not met Jaques Wagner (the supposed intermediary in negotiations with Rousseff). Declaring himself against the Workers\\\\ Party, he said he would rather not have the three votes from the party in the Council of Ethics..\\\\c\\\\cPolitical scientists heard by AgeÌncia Brasil on December 2015, commented on the political crisis. They stated that Rousseff\\\\s inability to negotiate with Congress, in addition to the political system, which allows the fragmenting and great number of political parties in Brazil, caused a loss of governability. Moreover, the opposition confronted Rousseff since elections on 2014, refuting the electoral results and calling for a recount of votes. Her campaign accounts was also disputed and the impeachment threat has destabilized the government. However, the outbreak of the process could be beneficial for Rousseff, who would be free from blackmail and could potentially reorganize her government. Political scientists believed Cunha could lose his mandate and that the opposition would try to push the process in Congress for 2016 in order to mitigate the electoral ecstasy and act of revenge that was the host of the application..\\\\c\\\\cIn CNT/MDA polls performed in March 2015, only 10.8% of Brazilians approved of Rouseff\\\\s government and 59.7% wanted her impeached. In July 2015, this number had risen to 62.8%. By April 2016, in polls performed by Datafolha Institute, 61% of Brazilians believed that Rousseff should have been impeached..\\\\c\\\\cSince 2012, a total of 37 requests for impeachment of president Dilma Rousseff have been presented to the Chamber of Deputies. However, only one request was accepted by then president of the Chamber Eduardo Cunha. The accepted request for impeachment was submitted by former congressman and attorney pt [HeÌlio Bicudo] and attorneys pt [Miguel Reale JuÌnior] and pt [Janaina Paschoal]. The request was based on allegations of omission concerning irregularities in Petrobras, fiscal responsibility crimes, and budgetary mismanagement..\\\\c\\\\cIn the course of Operation Car Wash, many illegal and suspicious operations were investigated, including the purchase of the Pasadena Refinery by Petrobras, a business that has proved extremely unfavourable to Brazil, according to the impeachment request. The financial losses were higher than R$700 million (US$320 million). Roussef was president of the Board of Directors of Petrobras and gave as excuse, a mistake concerning a contractual clause. According to the report, the President insisted in thesis that the allegations would be a kind of coup, mere attempt to weaken Petrobras, always emphasizing its expertise in economy and energy sector, namely, the President insisted on the company\\\\s financial health. She stepped down in Petrobras only in February 2015, when the situation was already untenable..\\\\c\\\\cThe report also denounces a corrupt scheme involving shady deals of former President Lula, who intermediated business of the Brazilian construction company Norberto Odebrecht in Cuba and Angola, which Rousseff had knowledge that were for the purpose of money laundering of corruption at Petrobras. Some international companies were chosen to be encouraged and, thereafter, participating in unrealistic bids, drain the state-owned company, giving back much of the values through seemingly licit donations. In statements taken from accused in Operation Car Wash, was found that Lula and Dilma knew of the bribery scheme in Petrobras..\\\\c\\\\cRousseff has edit in the years 2014 and 2015, six unnumbered decrees that resulted in the provision of additional credits to social programs with electoral purposes, without authorization from Congress. These values were in the amount of R$18.5 billion (US$6.9 billion) and were contracted in official financial institutions without the necessary legislative authorization, even with the targets set not being complied in the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law] and the pt [Annual Budgetary Law]. To obtain these additional credits, the target of 2014 was reduced by the end of 2014 by R$67 billion (US$25 billion), at the request of the president. The same conduct of the accused was committed in 2015. Rousseff, by means of decrees, authorized in the years 2014 and 2015, the opening credit, disregarding the Annual Budgetary Law and the Federal Constitution, precisely to allow the provision of additional resources when it was known that the primary superavit target in the Budget forecast was not being fulfilled, and would not be fulfilled..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2011 and 2014, the Union has held illegal credit operations from no transfer of funds to the national financial system entities controlled by the State. That practice was taken from financial advances made by official financial institutions, such as Caixa EconoÌmica Federal and Banco do Brasil for finance social programs of responsibility of the Federal Government. These transactions were reported in 2015 by Tribunal de Contas da UniaÌo and, according to the report, aimed at election results..\\\\c\\\\cThe Union contracted Caixa Economica Federal and Banco do Brasil as operators by Federal Government social programs. For this purpose, the Union should pass along directly from the pt [National Treasury Secretary] account, the necessary resources for the realization of programs each month, more precisely, would be obliged to transfer to the financial institutions the equivalent values for the equalization of interest rates, expenditures and legal transfers. But the government has not done these refunds and the contracted financial system entities made payments to programs beneficiaries with own resources and hence promoted the credit constitution in his favor against the Union. This procedure is a form of mutual credit, or similar operation and in accordance with the Fiscal Responsibility Law, art. 36, is prohibited to carry out credit operations between a state financial institution and the member of the Federation that controls it, as the borrower. The total balance of these liabilities by the end of August 2014 was R$1.74 billion (US$740 million). Of an amount of R$7.8 billion (US$2.9 billion) spent on subsidies in the programs between 2009 and 2014, only R$1.6 billion (US$590 million) was transferred by the Union..\\\\c\\\\cBy the end of 2014, Rousseff sent to the National Congress the PLN Nr. 362014, to change the pt [Budgetary Directives Law] aimed at modifying the rules of the primary superavit. Thus, has demonstrated knowledge of the results of the public accounts and which has taken the necessary steps to regularize them. However, he did just to meet your interest, as sought avoid being accused of a crime committed for not meet the fiscal targets set out in law..\\\\c\\\\cBoth the Federal Constitution and Article 4 of Law 1079/50, establish that give rise the impediment of the President the fact that attempt against probity in administration and against the budget law. Are crimes of responsibility against the budget law, order or authorize the opening of credit in disagreement with the limits set by the Senate, not well-founded in budget law or in additional credit law or inobservance of legal prescription;(Law Nr. 10028, 2000) and fail to promote or to order the full settlement of credit operations in anticipation of budget revenue, including related interest and other charges, until the end of the fiscal period; (Law Nr. 10028, 2000)..\\\\c\\\\cTherefore, there is a political violation, which may lead to the impeachment, by Legislative trial, and there is a civil offense, which entails indemnities and mandate cassation by the Judiciary. When the author of conduct is the President, also commit crime of responsibility, pursuant to art. 10 of Law n. 1079/50, amended by Law Nr. 10028/2000..\\\\c\\\\cThere were 37 requests for impeachment filed with the Chamber of Deputies by September 2015, against Dilma Rousseff, but the president\\\\s home only received the written request of pt [HeÌlio Bicudo] and the lawyers pt [Miguel Reale JuÌnior] and pt [Janaina Paschoal]. The social movement pro-impeachment (such as the Free Brazil Movement and pt [Come to the Street Movement]) decided to join Bicudo\\\\s request. It also had the support of parliamentarians and civil society, which organized a petition in support of the impeachment of the President of the Republic..\\\\c\\\\cLawyers, in the document presented to the House, tried to associate Dilma Rousseff with Operation Car Wash, cited failure in case of corruption, investigated influence peddling against former President Luiz InaÌcio Lula da Silva and fiscal pedaling. In addition, it contributed to support the request of six decrees signed by the president in the fiscal year of 2015 in disagreement with the law guidelining the budget, which were published without permission of the Congress..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the acceptance of the request, a special committee was formed in the Chamber of Deputies to decide on its admissibility. It began with the testimony of the authors of the request, followed by a presentation of Rousseff\\\\s defense. Meanwhile, street protests for and against the impeachment occurred periodically throughout the country. The committee\\\\s report was favorable to impeaching the President: 38 deputies approved the report while 27 did not..\\\\c\\\\cOn 17 April 2016, the Chamber of Deputies (the lower house of the Brazilian Parliament) concluded a general vote for the admission of the impeachment process. 367 members voted for impeachment, while 137 voted against, 7 abstained and 2 were absent from the session. The internal rules of the house stated that the process would be admitted only if it received at least 342 votes for, between the 513 sitting members. On the following day, the president of the Chamber, Eduardo Cunha, delivered the process to the Senate, upper legislative house, which follow the procedure and judged the case. On 5 May 2016, Teori Zavascki, judge of Supreme Federal Court decided that Eduardo Cunha must to step down from the presidency of the Chamber of Deputies and suspend his mandate, because he is facing a corruption trial. The decision was later endorsed by all eleven judges of Court and has not affected the process of impeachment against Dilma Rousseff..\\\\c\\\\cAfter the vote held in the Chamber on 17 April to allow the charges against the President to be presented to the Senate, the process was delivered by Cunha to the Senate and confirmed with a 55â22 vote on 12 May, in a section that lasted more than 20 hours, resulting in the suspension of Rousseff\\\\s presidential powers and duties up to 180 days. During this period, while the judgment of the process occurs (which decides whether the president should be convicted and removed from office, or acquitted with powers and duties restored), Rousseff\\\\s vice-president Michel Temer will serve as acting president..\\\\c\\\\cIn the Brazilian political system, the President and Vice President form a single electoral coalition. However, their terms are constitutionally separate. Michel Temer was President of the Chamber of Deputies during the Fernando Henrique Cardoso presidential mandate, from 1995 to 2002. Mr. Temer is a member of PMDB, which declared moving to opposition to Dilma Rousseff government on March 2016. According to some newspapers such as The Guardian, for those desperate for change, Temer represents salvation. Others, more concerned about the countryâs fragile democracy, believe he is the perpetrator of a coup. A separate proposal to impeach Michael Temer as Acting President and Vice President has been made..\\\\c\\\\cA CNT/MDA poll published on 8 June 2016, indicates that 11.3% of Brazilians approved and 28% censured the acting government of President Temer. For 30.2% of respondents, Temer\\\\s government is ordinary, while 30.5% not answered. The survey revealed that 46.6% of Brazilians believed that the corruption in government Temer could be equal to that experienced in government Rousseff. Also according to the poll, 28.3% believe that corruption could be lessen, while 18.6% estimated that it could be even greaten. Regarding to lawfulness in the process of impeachment, 61.5% agreeded with the conduction of the process, 33.3% answered negatively and 5.2% not answered. According to the survey agency, the CNT/MDA heard 2,002 people in 137 municipalities in 25 federative units from 2 to 5 June. The margin of error was 2.2 percentage points, with 95% of reliability..\\\\c\\\\cA poll of Ipsos Consulting, by early July 2016, concluded that 16% of Brazilians had preferred Temer definitely in office. For 20%, Rousseff should be acquitted and reconducted to office to conclude her four-year mandate. 52% answered that both, Temer or Roussef, whoever that assume the command of the nation, must call new elections for president. However, anticipate elections can only occur with the approval of a large majority of Congress (three-fifths) or Temer and Rousseff resign simultaneously, that would be unlikely. Otherwise, both could be removed from their offices, depending on the outcome of a lawsuit filed in Superior Electoral Court by the PSDB, party of AeÌcio Neves, then defeated candidate in the presidential elections of 2014, claiming that there was electoral crime in the political campaign of the alliance Rousseff-Temer, with donations made by companies investigated in the Operation Car Wash. In the poll, 12% were undecided or not answered. Were heard 1,200 people in 72 Brazilian municipalities. The margin of error was 3 percentage points..\\\\c\\\\cAccording to the pt [National Confederation of Industry], the industry confidence index reached 47.3 points on July 2016, from 45.7 in June, 10.1 points higher than July 2015. According to Brazilian Institute of Geography and Statistics, the pt [National Index of Consumer Prices Broad] in Brazil decreased from 0.78% in May 2016 to 0.35% in June 2016, the lowest index since August 2015..\\\\c\\\\cCompleted the phases of appreciation and admissibility of the impeachment process, the subsequent procedure requires new citations, instruction with gathering of evidences and witness testimonies to support the decision. The Senate, in a plenary session, pronounce by a simple majority if the charges are well-founded or not to the decisive judgment. The first task is Rousseff notification to allow a new defence. For this whole second phase of the process, the Committee is supported by the president of Supreme Federal Court, Ricardo Lewandowski. The last phase of the trial, that decided by the conviction or acquittal of the withdrawn President, is chaired by Lewandowski, on the condition of Supreme Court president. On this decisive voting, two-thirds of the votes (54 of the total of 81 senators) are needed to permanently remove the President..\\\\c\\\\c1 June 2016 completed the 20-day period to suspended President Dilma Rousseff formalize a previous defence for the trial in the Senate. The document was personally registered on Senate by Rousseff\\\\s lawyer, former Minister of Justice and former General\\\\s Office attorney JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo..\\\\c\\\\cIn the 370-page document, besides the reasons already claimed on the previous phase, that the president has not committed the alleged crimes of responsibility, it is stated that the just cause or reason aimed at the need for consummation of Rousseff\\\\s impeachment was only and exclusively the aim at end up the Operation Car Wash. For this statement, Cardozo was supported by the transcripts of an occultly recorded conversation among pt [SeÌrgio Machado (politician and businessman)], former president of Transpetro (a Petrobras subsidiary), and the senator Romero JucaÌ, a politician with influential leadership in the Brazilian party PMDB, published by the newspaper Folha de S. Paulo. In the concept of Cardozo, the dialogue indicated that they were trying to obstruct the investigation sprawling, due to the risk of both be caught up and suggest that Rousseff\\\\s impeachment could have been part of an agreement aiming to prevent and possibly even cease the investigations in the Operation Car Wash. Otherwise, the lawyer of senator JucaÌ said that his client never thought to perform any interference in the Operation Car Wash and the dialogue does not suggest that..\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 May 2016, the senator Antonio Anastasia, rapporteur of the Special Committee of Impeachment 2016 (CEI 2016), presented the work plan for the trial. Workers Party senators complained about the haste to adjudicate. The Committee\\\\s president Raimundo Lira accepted the request and the next meeting was scheduled to 2 June, for analysis of new deadlines..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 June 2016, the Committee has appreciated the report with new work plan deadlines presented by the rapporteur Anastasia and requests by senators. The session, that lasted over nine hours, was attended by Roussef\\\\s lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo. Anastasia has proposed by 7 July the final arguments of the prosecution and the defence. Once, the Worker Party senators disagreed with deadlines and decided that they would presented a new revision of the deadlines for analisys of the president of Court, Ricardo Levandowsy. Anastasia also rejected to append in process, the recording of the conversation among SeÌrgio Machado and the senator Romero JucaÌ, required by Cardozo. In his understanding, it would be irrelevant to the process, since that the charges against Roussef were fiscal responsibility crimes and the recording was only an informal conversation and nothing could proved legally. Cardozo protested against the decision, claiming that the facts cited in the record were a main object of the investigation. The report was voted and approved just at 20h40. Earlier, the Workers Party senators and the attorney Cardozo withdrew from the meeting, after accusing the Committee\\\\s president Lira to lessen the rights of defence. Cardozo has announced on 3 June, that would submit appeals of that decisions to president of Supeme Court, Lewandowski..\\\\c\\\\cOn 6 June, the Committee approved the work plan and deadlines presented by the rapporteur Anastasia..\\\\c\\\\cOn 7 June, Lewandowski denied the appeal filed by Cardozo to append the recording of SeÌrgio Machado, supported by a previous manifestation of the Court, that evidences collected in this kind of testimony are sheltered by confidentiality until the beginning of a formal investigation. SeÌrgio Machado was arrested and introduced the recording of the conversation during his interrogatory. Besides, the subject under appeal had been discussed in prior decisions of the Court. Lewandowski also denied another appeal of senator Aloysio Nunes, former member of the Committee, to reduce the number of witnesses. On 2 June meeting, the Committee established that would be heard eight witnesses for each fact aimed against Rousseff, both for the prosecution and for the defence, i.e. a total of 48 witnesses for each side, with each supplemental budget decree that motivated the request for impeachment, considered separately. Lewandowski held that the Commission\\\\s decision should respect the right to legal defence. Nunes intended that the six decrees were as a unique fact, to be added to the so-called tax pedaling, which should considered another fact, so that the number of witnesses to be heard could be reduced to 16..\\\\c\\\\cThereafter, on 8 June meeting, the Committee accepted a request of both, defence and prosecution, reducing to four the number of supplemental budget decrees to be considered in the trial, as crime of responsibility by President Rousseff. Thus, the number of witnesses in the process was also reduced to forty. Since each charge entitle eight witnesses, the defence of Rousseff could introduce up to 32 witnesses for the four decrees and eight for the tax pedaling charge. The prosecution would be entitled the same number of witnesses. The decision to reduce the charges was supported on a report produced at the course on the House of Representatives, that considered two decrees signed by Rousseff without approval of Congress were neutral from fiscal perspective, once the primary sources and financial expenses listed in these documents were equivalent..\\\\c\\\\cOn 8 June began the witnesses hearings, beginning with the convened by prosecution. Rousseff\\\\s lawyer Jose Eduardo Cardozo and prosecutors JanaiÌna Paschoal and Miguel Reale Junior also attended the meeting. Four witnesses, indicated by the authors of the impeachment request, were heard in the meeting, that lasted over 14 hours, from 11h40 to 2h10 on 9 June: the procurator of the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, the auditor of TCU, Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho, the Credit Operations manager of the pt [National Treasury Secretary], Adriano Pereira de Paula, and the deputy secretary of the National Treasury, Otavio Ladeira de Medeiros..\\\\c\\\\cFraud is the will of, free and consciously, to practice the misconduct and get the result. And that\\\\s what the President did. She edited the decrees by a free and conscious mode to increase costs, that could not increased by a decree. She should sent a bill..\\\\c\\\\cJulio Marcelo de Oliveira said that in April 2015, TCU has identified the recidivist fiscal misconduct, so-called tax pedaling, immediately rejected. There was not previous understanding to modified the rules and the consensus, every time that the TCU has ruled, was disapproved this conduct adopted illegally by Rousseff. He also reiterated that the President acted intentionally to borrow from public banks, that acted coercively in these operations. This, in his opinion, is serious, and forbidden by the pt [Fiscal Responsibility Law]. The practice, he said, lasted years, including throughout the year 2015..\\\\c\\\\cThe auditor of TCU, Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho said that the fiscal practices by Rousseff were unprecedented. He also reiterated that the misconducts committed has caused serious outcomes..\\\\c\\\\cOn 9 and 10 June there were no Committee meetings. From 13 to 17 June, there were five meetings, with hearings of sixteen witnesses, two by prosecution and fourteen by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 13 June, were heard the prosecution witnesses Tiago Alves de Gouveia Lins Dutra and Leonardo Rodrigues Albernaz, both TCU auditors. Tiago Dutra said that Rousseff held credit operations with public banks in 2015 that had already observed in 2014. A TCU report pointed a delay of eleven months in the amount of R$2.6 billion, and five months in transfers of R$3 billion, related to the operations. For principal and interest, until December 2015, the government have been paid R$15 billion, of which R$2 billion were related to interest. According Leonardo Albernaz, more than fifty auditors accomplished an analysis of Rousseff accounts and concluded unanimously that her administration has made the most reckless management of public finances since the Fiscal Responsibility Law was enacted in May 2000..\\\\c\\\\cThe Committeeâs President, Raimundo Lira, announced the decision of the President of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski, authorizing an audit in the documents, requested by the defence. Lira designated a board consisting of three experts, granting to prosecution, defence and the Senators 48 hours to formulate questions and indicate technical assistants, as well as 24 hours to refute the appointed experts, fixing also a ten days deadline for the completion of audit..\\\\c\\\\cI don\\\\t understand that it was a credit operation, but a rendering of services. At no time that the Union pays to bank was directly related to what the producers has received. The producers received from the bank itself. The Union participation doesn\\\\t characterize a credit operation between the Union and public banks..\\\\c\\\\cOn 14 June, were heard the first witnesses convened by defence, the former National Secretary of Planning and Strategic Investment, Gilson Bittencourt, and the former Secretary of Agricultural Policy of the Ministry of Agriculture, AndreÌ Nassar. Bittencourt said that there was no credit operation between the Union and public banks and also denied that there was delay in the payment of interest to public banks in 2015. According Bittencourt, the debit to be paid in 2016 came to be due only at the time of collection by the banks, that is done every six months. AndreÌ Nassar said that the Bank of Brazil had interest in to circulate money, by lend to producers, even getting the transfers delayed by the government. He also said that, as Secretary of Agricultural Policy and from the point of view of the agricultural sector, this was the most important to avoid a discontinuity that, if had occurred, would generated serious outcomes to the sector..\\\\c\\\\cOn 15 June, were heard three witnesses convened by defence, the former Deputy Secretary of the Federal Budget Office, Cilair Rodrigues de Abreu, the former Secretary of Budget and Administration of the Ministry of Social Security, JoseÌ Geraldo FrancÌ§a Diniz and the Juridical Consultant of the Ministry of Planning, Budget, and Management, Walter Baere de ArauÌjo Filho. Cilair Rodrigues said that the understanding of the TCU before 2015 was ever that the future target could be used by Secretary of Budget in the publication of their reports. This understanding has changed, he said, only on 2015. FrancÌ§a Diniz commented that, due the process complexity for supplemental budget decrees, the documents are reviewed by experts and the President could not accomplish a whole analysis of the documents. Rousseff signed, but it would impossible to analyse in details 200 pages of attachments, calculations and spreadsheets. Walter Baere said that the TCU never emitted formal advices concerning the illegality of the issue of supplemental budget decrees by the President. He said also that the TCU has the specific legal duty to alert when there is a possibility of not achieving the fiscal targets..\\\\c\\\\cOn 16 June, were heard four witnesses convened by defence, the former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Education, pt [Luiz ClaÌudio Costa], the former Secretary Executive Assistant of the Ministry of Education, Wagner Vilas Boas, the Assistant Secretary of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Education, Iara Ferreira Pinho and the Director of the Department of Economic Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Clayton Luiz Montes.According to Luiz Claudio Costa, the supplemental budget decree for the Ministry of Education, was important for the management, enabling several sectors linked to the Ministry, such as universities, institutes and others, should adequate their budget to the instant needs. Vilas Boas explained that it was not granting of the Ministry of Education to evaluate the impact of the credit opening for obtaining the primary balance target. He said that the sectorial authority - in this case the agencies of the Ministry - make a request for supplemental budget, but are liable to policy guidance and technical supervision by the budget agency. Both, Wagner Vilas Boas and Iara Pinho, said they could not give an opinion on the compatibility of the signed supplementary decrees and the current fiscal target since their functions donât allow to accomplish analysis of the achievement of the target. Concerning these statements, the prosecution pointed out that the technicians were not able to explain specifically about the possible crime of responsibility. The witnesses left shown that unaware the facts. Our claim is that the evidence shall excusedâ, said prosecution lawyer, Janaina Paschoal, after the testimony of Iara Pinho..\\\\c\\\\cClayton Luiz Montes said that âthe government has followed the new understanding of the TCU by October 2015. Since that time, were not sent any credit decreesâ. This, nevertheless, is conflicting with the statements of TCU auditors, that there was not previous understanding to modified the rules..\\\\c\\\\cOn 17 June, were heard five witnesses convened by defence, the former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management, Nelson Barbosa, the former Minister of Education, pt [JoseÌ Henrique Paim], the Director of the Department of Infrastructure Programs of the Federal Budget Secretary,  Zarak de Oliveira Ferreira, the  Analyst of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Planning, Budget and Management, Antonio JoseÌ Chatack Carmelo, and the Planning and Budget Analyst of the Federal Budget Office, Georgimar Martiniano de Sousa..\\\\c\\\\cNelson Barbosa said that the additional credit decrees issued by President Rousseff from June to August 2015 not prevented the fulfilment of the fiscal target approved by Congress in early 2015 and, since is an supplemental credit that has no impact on the target, was not considered a target of primary balance, but to give more autonomy to the allocation of a value already available. Henrique Paim said that the decrees were essential to the functioning of various sectors of Education, including scientific research and operation of universities. Moreover, according to the former minister, the additional credits are often edited based on revenue generation, provided by budget units, linked to the Ministry. Also the technicians Zarak de Oliveira, Chatack Carmelo and Georgimar Martiniano, have not seen incompatibility of supplemental decrees with the fiscal target..\\\\c\\\\cFrom 20 to 24 June, there were five meetings, with hearings of fifteen witnesses, all convened  by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 20 June, were heard four witnesses, the former Deputy Chief for Legal Affairs of Staff of the Presidency, Ivo da Motta Azevedo Correa, the former Minister of Education, Renato Janine Ribeiro, the Director of the Department of Social Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Felipe Daruich Neto and the former Deputy Executive Secretary of the Staff of the Presidency, Bruno Moretti. Ivo Correa said that an alert of the TCU is not a decision of the Court, therefore, the government relied on previous jurisprudence to edit the decrees. Janine Ribeiro said that not has received any alert of the TCU about irregularities in the supplemental budget decrees when Minister of Education. Daruich Neto saids that, at any time, as occurred any intentional misconduct and is impracticable to the President evaluate all decrees, before sign it..\\\\c\\\\cOn 21 June, were heard four witnesses, the former Minister of the pt [Secretary of Human Rights], pt [Pepe Vargas], the former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management and former President of Caixa EconoÌmica Federal, pt [Miriam Belchior], the Planning and Budget Analyst and former Deputy Secretary of Planning and Budget of the Ministry of Justice, Orlando MagalhaÌes da Cunha and the Coordinator of Budget and Finance of the Ministry of Justice, Marcelo Minghelli. The former Minister Pepe Vargas asserted that the supplemental credit to Secretary of Human Rights was derived not just from Treasury resources, but of surplus resources of funds obtained through donations by individuals and corporations. Mirian Belchior said that the supplemental budget decrees, by which Rousseff is indicted were lawful and was impossible increase the resources contingency as made in 2015..\\\\c\\\\cOn 22 June, were heard three witnesses, the Planning and Budget Analyst and General Coordinator of Technology and Information of the Federal Budget Office, Robson Azevedo Rung, the Secretary of Institutional Organization of the Ministry of Defence, Luiz Antonio de Souza Cordeiro and the Representative of the Superior Labor Court, Luciano Carlos de Almeida. Azevedo Rung said that the Federal Budget Office received a new interpretation from TCU only in 2015, concerning to procedures that ever were well settled..\\\\c\\\\cAlso on this meeting, the Committee approved a new timetable for the trial. On 6 July, testimony of Rousseff, who can be represented by her lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo. From 7 to 12 July, final arguments of the prosecution and from 13 to 27 July, final arguments of the defence. On 9 August, discussion and voting of the report in plenary and 22 August, the estimated date to decisive judgment..\\\\c\\\\cOn 23 June, were heard two witnesses, the  Deputy Secretary of Planning, Budget and Administration of the Ministry of Science, Technology and Innovation, Anderson Lozi da Rocha and the former Secretary of Federal Budget, Esther Dweck. Dweck denied that the supplemental budget decrees in 2015 has contributed to the breach of the target for primary surplus for that year..\\\\c\\\\cOn 24 June, were heard two witnesses, the former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Labor and Employment, Francisco JoseÌ Pontes Ibiapina and the Director of Special Programs of the Secretary of Federal Budget, Marcos de Oliveira Ferreira. Pontes Ibiapina said that the supplemental budget decrees were published to aid programs as the transfer of resources to States and Municipalities, by the pt [National Employment System] and other programs..\\\\c\\\\cFrom 27 to 29 June happened three meetings, with hearings of nine witnesses, all convened  by defence..\\\\c\\\\cOn 27 June, was heard pt [Patrus Ananias], former Ministry of Agrarian Development. Ananias said that he unknowledge the tax pedaling and the resources were transferred from the Bank of Brazil directly to producers with subsidized interest rates, due to the heed that agriculture deserves..\\\\c\\\\cOn 28 June, were heard pt [Maria Fernanda Ramos Coelho], former Executive Secretary of the Ministry of Agrarian Development, Aldo Rebelo, former Ministry of Defence, LuiÌs InaÌcio Adams, former General\\\\s Office attorney and AntoÌnio Carlos Stangherlin Rebelo, technical responsible for analysis of supplemental credits on the National Justice Council.Maria Fernanda said that the delay in the payment of interest rate equalization of the Plan Safra (government\\\\s plan to support agriculture) for 2015, does not configure a credit operation, since the noncompliance was not subject to penalty payment in the contract term. According to former secretary, the values were only monetarily adjusted. The prosecution lawyer pt [JanaiÌna Paschoal] rejected the claims of Maria Fernanda and said that the remuneration per pt [interest rate SELIC] (a benchmark interest rate of the Brazilian economy) is a proof that there was a credit operation. The prosecution reiterates that this statement confirmed the infringement materiality, she concluded. Aldo Rebelo rejected the accusations that the government spent wantonly in 2015, and that year was characterized by fiscal adjustments and efforts to reduce the public spending..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 June, were heard JoaÌo Luiz Guadagnin, Director of the Department of Finance and Production Protection of the Ministry of Agrarian Development, Marcel Mascarenhas dos Santos, Prosecutor of the Central Bank, Fernando Rocha, Deputy Head of the Economic Department of the Central Bank, and Paulo JoseÌ dos Reis Souza, Finance and Control Analyst and Fiscal Policy Secretary on the pt [National Treasury Secretary]..\\\\c\\\\cThe phase of witnesses hearings had concluded on 29 June. A total of 44 witnesses were heard, six convened by prosecution and 38 by defence..\\\\c\\\\cAt the end of the witnesses hearings phase, both the prosecution and the defence lawyers said they were confident about their theses. The prosecution lawyer, Janaina Paschoal, criticized the actions of Rousseff\\\\s defense due the great number of witnesses convened, with clear dilatory intention, and the most of witnesses unknows accurately the facts. The defence lawyer, JoseÌ Eduardo Cardozo also expressed confidence, but said that the process has a political nature and this may interfere in the result. He also pointed out that some senators refused to discuss with the witnesses, because they were already a judgment before the completion of work..\\\\c\\\\cOn 5 July 2016, was heard the board of experts designated by the Committeeâs President, Raimundo Lira on 13 June 2016 meeting, to accomplish an audit in the documents, requested by the defence, and authorized  by the President of the Supreme Court, Ricardo Lewandowski.The board, composed by the auditors JoaÌo Henrique Pederiva, Prandino Diego Alves and Fernando Alvaro LeaÌo Rincon, submitted the audit report results. According them, the delays in the transfer of payments to the public banks constituted loans. However, they avoided consider whether there was intent of the President and said that this judgment will be up to senators. After, were also heard the assistant by prosecution, Selene PeÌres Nunes and the assistant by defense, Ricardo Lodi Ribeiro. Selene Nunes pointed out that there was willful misconduct by the President, since the operations were hidden by accounting and, later, the government has issued a pt [provisional measure] allowing the payment of debts. The assistant by defense, Ricardo Ribeiro, said that the President has no responsibility for the issue of the supplemental budget decrees because they were submitted to her signature by the technical areas of the ministries and her participation, as demonstrated in the report, was only the signing of these decrees..\\\\c\\\\cOn 6 July, would be carried out a Rousseff\\\\s interrogatory, however she declined to attend the Committee and sent a letter, read entirely by Cardozo. Rousseff defended herself, claiming that she was a victim of a conspiracy, repeating the arguments that have been mentioned from the process beginning. The final arguments by prosecution were delivered to Committee on 12 July, and the final arguments by defense were delivered to Committee on 28 July, for preparation of the final report by rapporteur, Antonio Anastasia..\\\\c\\\\cOn 2 August, Anastasia submitted the final report, concluding by Rousseff\\\\s culpability. On 3 August, the document was discussed by the Committee. JoaÌo Correia Serra, prosecution lawyer in lieu, praised Anastasia\\\\s report and stressed the known centralizing temperament of Rousseff, that reinforces the impossibility of the withdrawn President not being aware or not directly commanded the acts for which she was accused. Otherwise, Cardozo said that he was sure that Anastasia\\\\s report does not evinced that Rousseff has committed crimes, and accused the rapporteur, despite his aptitude and usual brilliance, managed his actions within the opinion of his party. On 4 August, the report was voted and approved by 14-5 vote, closing the work of the Committee and following for voting in the Senate floor on 9 August, chaired by Ricardo Lewandowski, Supreme Federal Court president..\\\\c\\\\cIn a long section, started at 9:40 am on 9 August and lasted over sixteen hours, the Senate floor approved on early morning of 10 August, the final report of Anastasia. By 59-21 vote, the indictments against Dilma Rousseff had upheld, ending the penultimate phase of the process, called pronunciation and determining the final judgment in the Senate, beginning on 25 August. In this judgment, two-thirds of 81 senators are necessary to remove the President from office and make her ineligible for office, for eight years subsequent to 1 January 2019, when her second term would end..\\\\c\\\\cThe last phase of the trial has three steps:.\\\\c\\\\cOn 25 August, began the witnesses inquiries, in a stired section, that lasted over fifteen hours. By prosecution, had convened two witnesses, Julio Marcelo de Oliveira, procurator of the Federal Court of Accounts (TCU), author of the report recommending the rejection of 2014 accounts, and Antonio Carlos Costa D\\\\avila Carvalho JuÌnior, auditor of TCU. Oliveira was inquired as informant and not witness, as decided by Lewandowski, after Cardozo accused him that made its report based in a biased understanding. Oliveira refused, claiming that only fulfilled a recommendation to adopt a less tolerant rule came from TCU. Oliveira reiterated that Rousseff broke budget laws in 2014 and also in 2015. In the condition of informant, Oliveira complaints cannot be considered as evidence for the process, but as technical information. The next prosecution witness inquired, D\\\\Avila Carvalho, reiterates that Rousseff disguised the accounting and was responsible for delaying transfers to state banks. Cardozo also tried to desqualify D\\\\Avila as witness, accusing him of biased conduct, because he helped the prosecutor Oliveira to draft the TCU report. Cardozo pleaded that was a clearly an unethical situation that violates the principle of impartiality. However, Lewandowski denied the request..\\\\c\\\\cThe inquiries continued on 26 and 27 August. Six witness were convened by defence: pt [Luiz Gonzaga Belluzzo], economist, Geraldo Luiz Mascarenhas Prado, legal advisor, pt [Luiz ClaÌudio Costa], Ministry of Education, Nelson Barbosa, former Minister of Planning, Budget and Management, Esther Dweck, former Secretary of Federal Budget and Ricardo Ribeiro Lodi, Law professor at the State University of Rio de Janeiro. Dweck was dispensed by Lewandowski, since there would be a conflict of interest, once she was being contracted for the office of Gleisi Hoffmann, one of the senators opposed to impeachment. Gonzaga Belluzzo  and Ribeiro Lodi were heard in the condition of informant..\\\\c\\\\cBelluzo said that interruption of a mandate achieved by universal suffrage is something that should require very special care. It could only be done in extreme situations, and that trial had not facing it..\\\\c\\\\cFor Mascarenhas Prado, by signing the decrees, the President acted in reliance on the advice of his subordinates, which attested to the legality of acts. As for ClaÌudio Costa, the supplementary credit decrees were used in educational programs. The senador CaÌssio Cunha Lima refused, saying that crime is not the expansion of universities and technical schools, but the lack of Congress authorization for such decrees..\\\\c\\\\cNelson Barbosa said that decrees provides more leeway to the administration of funds, when the budget is limited, and are edited by experienced officials. Pro-impeachment senators insisted that those actions have aggravated the economic crisis that facing the country. Barbosa said that the crisis was due to various internal and external factors. At last, Ribeiro Lodi stated that the decrees issued by the President in July and August 2015 were not considered violations until then by TCU and at that moment, when the decrees were issued, this understanding did not exist..\\\\c\\\\cOn 29 August, Rousseff attended the Senate, to defend herself..\\\\c\\\\c(CNN) Brazil\\\\s first female president is out of a job, but not barred from the ballot if she wants to run again. The South American country\\\\s Senate voted 61-20 Wednesday to remove President Dilma Rousseff from office, finding her guilty of breaking budgetary laws in an impeachment trial. Temer, 75, inherits a tattered economy, along with the keys to the presidential palace in Brasilia, the nation\\\\s capital. He met with his Cabinet and promised to tackle unemployment.

The Senate\\\\s decision is a major blow for Rousseff, a member of the Workers\\\\ Party, but it might not mark the end of her political career. While the vote to oust her from office was decisive, a motion to bar her from holding any public office for the next eight years failed.

The heir-apparent to former President Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva, Rousseff was re-elected by a narrow margin in 2014, but a recession and a cross-party corruption scandal put an end to any political goodwill she might have earned, eventually leading to her ouster.

Relations between the United States and the Philippines have historically been strong and have been been described as a Special Relationship.[citation needed]The United States is the Philippines\\\\ closest ally in the world,[citation needed] the Philippines being one of the oldest Asian partners of the U.S. and a strategic major non-NATO ally. The United States has consistently been cited as one of the Filipinos\\\\ favorite nations in the world, with 90% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and 91% viewing Americans favorably in 2002, 90% of Filipinos viewing U.S. influence positively in 2011, 85% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. and Americans favorably in 2013, and 92% of Filipinos viewing the U.S. favorably in 2015, and 89% having confidence in United States president, Barack Obama in 2014, making the Philippines the most pro-American country in the world..\\\\c\\\\cThis article discusses PhilippineâAmerican relations after Philippine independence from the United States in 1946, while the article History of the Philippines (1898â1946) describes the history of the Philippines during American colonial rule..\\\\c\\\\cPursuant to the 1947 Military Bases Agreement, the United States maintained and operated major facilities at Clark Air Base until November 1991, and at Subic Bay Naval Complex and several small subsidiary installations in the Philippines until November 1992. In July 1991, negotiators from the two countries reached agreement on a draft treaty providing for the clean-up and turn over of Clark to the Philippine government in 1992, and for the lease of Subic Bay Naval Base by the U.S. for ten years. By 1991, operations at Clark had already been scaled back because of the end of the Cold War, with the last combat aircraft leaving in 1990, before the base was heavily damaged by the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo..\\\\c\\\\cOn September 16, 1991, the Philippine Senate rejected the bases treaty by a slim margin, and despite further efforts to salvage the situation, the two sides could not reach an agreement. As a result, the Philippine Government informed the U.S. on December 6, 1991, that it would have one year to complete withdrawal. That withdrawal went smoothly and was completed ahead of schedule, with the last U.S. forces departing on November 24, 1992. On departure, the U.S. Government turned over assets worth more than $1.3 billion to the Philippines, including an airport and ship-repair facility. Agencies formed by the Philippine Government have converted the former military bases for civilian commercial use, with Subic Bay serving as a flagship for that effort. The Philippine government on July 16, 2015 announced that it will revive a US-built deep-water naval base in Subic Bay..\\\\c\\\\cThe post-U.S. bases era has seen U.S.-Philippine relations improved and broadened, with a prominent focus on economic and commercial ties while maintaining the importance of the security dimension. U.S. investment continues to play an important role in the Philippine economy, while a strong security relationship rests on the 1951 U.S.-Philippines Mutual Defense Treaty (MDT). In February 1998, U.S. and Philippine negotiators concluded the Visiting Forces Agreement (VFA), paving the way for increased military cooperation under the MDT. The agreement was approved by the Philippine Senate in May 1999 and entered into force on June 1, 1999. Under the VFA, the U.S. has conducted ship visits to Philippine ports and has resumed large combined military exercises with Philippine forces. Key events in the bilateral relationship include the July 4, 1996 declaration by President Ramos of Philippine-American Friendship Day in commemoration of the 50th anniversary of Philippine independence. Ramos visited the U.S. in April 1998, and then-President Estrada visited in July 2000. President Arroyo met with President Bush in an official working visit in November 2001 and made a state visit in Washington on May 19, 2003. President Bush made a state visit to the Philippines on October 18, 2003, during which he addressed a joint session of the Philippine Congressâthe first American President to do so since Dwight D. Eisenhower. There are regular U.S. cabinet-level and congressional visits to the Philippines as well..\\\\c\\\\cPresident Arroyo repeatedly stressed the close friendship between the Philippines and the U.S. and her desire to expand bilateral ties further. Both governments tried to revitalize and strengthen their partnership by working toward greater security, prosperity, and service to Filipinos and Americans alike. Inaugurated into office on the same day as President Bush, President Arroyo lent strong support to the Global War on Terrorism. In October 2003, the U.S. designated the Philippines as a Major non-NATO ally. That same month, the Philippines joined the select group of countries to have ratified all 12 UN counterterrorism conventions..\\\\c\\\\cThe annual Balikatan (Shoulder-to-Shoulder) bilateral military exercises contribute directly to the Philippine armed forces\\\\ efforts to root out Abu Sayyaf and Jemaah Islamiyah terrorists and bring development to formerly terrorist-plagued areas, notably Basilan and Jolo. They include not only combined military training but also civil-military affairs and humanitarian projects. The International Military Education and Training (IMET) program is the largest in the Pacific and the third-largest in the world, and a Mutual Logistics Support Agreement (MLSA) was signed in November 2002. Similarly, law enforcement cooperation has reached new levels: U.S. and Philippine agencies have cooperated to bring charges against numerous terrorists, to implement the countries\\\\ extradition treaty, and to train thousands of Filipino law enforcement officers. There is a Senior Law Enforcement Advisor helping the Philippine National Police with its Transformation Program..\\\\c\\\\cThe U.S. works closely with the Philippines to reduce poverty and increase prosperity. The U.S. fully supports Philippine efforts to root out corruption, to open economic opportunity, and to invest in health and education. USAID programs support the \\\\Philippines\\\\ war on poverty as well as the government\\\\s reform agenda in critical areas, including anti-money laundering, rule of law, tax collection, and trade and investment. Other USAID programs have bolstered the government\\\\s efforts to heal divisions in Philippine society through a focus on conflict resolution, livelihood enhancement for former combatants, and economic development in Mindanao and the Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, among the poorest areas in the country. Meanwhile, important programs continue in modern family planning, infectious disease control, environmental protection, rural electrification, and provision of basic servicesâas well as PL 480 food aid programs and others, which together totaled $211.3 million. In 2006, the Millennium Challenge Corporation granted $21 million to the Philippines for a threshold program addressing corruption in revenue administration..\\\\c\\\\cNearly 400,000 Americans visit the Philippines each year. Providing government services to U.S. and other citizens, therefore, constitutes an important aspect of the bilateral relationship. Those services include veterans\\\\ affairs, social security, and consular operations. Benefits to Filipinos from the U.S. Department of Veterans Affairs and the Social Security Administration totaled $297,389,415 in 2006. Many people-to-people programs exist between the U.S. and the Philippines, including Fulbright, International Visitors, and Aquino Fellowship exchange programs, as well as the U.S. Peace Corps..\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2014, a ten-year pact Enhanced Defense Cooperation Agreement (EDCA) was signed between the U.S. President Barack Obama and the Philippine President Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines..\\\\c\\\\cTwo-way U.S. merchandise trade with the Philippines amounted to $17.3 billion in 2006 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). According to Philippine Government data, 16% of the Philippines\\\\ imports in 2006 came from the U.S., and about 18% of its exports were bound for America. The Philippines ranks as the 26th-largest export market and the 30th-largest supplier of the United States. Key exports to the U.S. are semiconductor devices and computer peripherals, automobile parts, electric machinery, textiles and garments, wheat and animal feeds, and coconut oil. In addition to other goods, the Philippines imports raw and semi-processed materials for the manufacture of semiconductors, electronics and electrical machinery, transport equipment, and cereals and cereal preparations..\\\\c\\\\cThe U.S. traditionally has been the Philippines\\\\ largest foreign investor, with about $6.6 billion in estimated investment as of end-2005 (U.S. Department of Commerce data). Since the late 1980s, the Philippines has committed itself to reforms that encourage foreign investment as a basis for economic development, subject to certain guidelines and restrictions in specified areas. Under President Ramos, the Philippines expanded reforms, opening the power generation and telecommunications sectors to foreign investment, as well as securing ratification of the Uruguay Round agreement and membership in the World Trade Organization. As noted earlier, President Arroyo\\\\s administration has generally continued such reforms despite opposition from vested interests and nationalist blocs. A major obstacle has been and will continue to be constitutional restrictions on, among others, foreign ownership of land and public utilities, which limits maximum ownership to 40%..\\\\c\\\\cOver the last two decades, the relatively closed Philippine economy has been opened significantly by foreign exchange deregulation, foreign investment and banking liberalization, tariff and market barrier reduction, and foreign entry into the retail trade sector. The Electric Power Industry Reform Act of 2001 opened opportunities for U.S. firms to participate in the power industry in the Philippines. Information and communications technologies, backroom operations such as call centers, and regional facilities or shared-service centers are likewise leading investment opportunities..\\\\c\\\\cDuring the visit by President Benigno Aquino III to Washington DC, on July 7, 2012, the US-Philippine Society was launched. It is a non-profit independent organisation tasked for generating awareness about the Philippines in the US. The last board meeting was conducted by the society on January 24, 2013..\\\\c\\\\cIn its 2013 Special 301 Report, the Office of the United States Trade Representatives wrote The United States looks to the Philippines to take important steps to address piracy over the internet, in particular with respect to notorious online markets. It is speculated that pressure from the United States contributed to the complaint filed by Philippine Association of the Record Industry against the torrent website KickassTorrents, resulting in its seizure by Philippine authorities on June 13, 2013..\\\\c\\\\cU.S. Assistant Secretary of State for East Asian and Pacific Affairs Kurt M. Campbell said in January 2011 that the United States will help boost the capacity of the Philippines to patrol their own waters, including the Spratly islands..\\\\c\\\\cThe 1951 mutual-defense treaty was reaffirmed with the November 2011 Manila Declaration. United States Chief of Naval Operations Admiral Jonathan Greenert suggested that LCS or surveillance aircraft may be deployed to the Philippines. And the Philippines is considering the proposal. These rotational deployments will help replace some of the American presence in the area that was given up when the permanent American bases in the Philippines were closed under President Bush..\\\\c\\\\cIn 2012 the Philippines and the United States conducted joint military exercises. As of 2012, a U.S. military contingent of 600, including Navy Seals and Seabees are stationed indefinitely in the Southern Philippines, in a declared non-combatant role to assist the Armed Forces of the Philippines in operations against the al-Quaida-linked Abu Sayyaf terrorist group primarily on the island of Basilan in western Mindanao and the Sulu islands, in particular Jolo, a long-time stronghold of Abu Sayyaf..\\\\c\\\\cThe Scarborough Shoal standoff with China and the ongoing Spratly islands dispute has caused the Philippines to consider stronger military ties with the United States. In 2012, a senior Philippine defense official said that as long as they have prior clearance from the Philippine government, American troops, warships and aircraft could once again use their former naval and air facilities of Subic Bay Naval Base and Clark Air Base. In 2013, Foreign Secretary, Albert del Rosario clarified that, due to constitutional constraints, establishment of a US military facility could only be allowed if it would be under the control of the Philippine military. The deal will reportedly include shared access to Philippines military but not civilian facilities..\\\\c\\\\cDuring a 2013 visit to the Philippines, Deputy Defense Secretary, Ashton Carter said that the main security issues that the USA was working with the Philippines  were:.\\\\c\\\\cIn April 2014, a ten-year pact (EDCA â Enhanced Defence Co-operation Agreement) was signed between the U.S. President, Barack Obama and the Philippine President, Benigno Aquino III, allowing United States to increase military presence in the Philippines..\\\\c\\\\cThe U.S. maintains an embassy in Manila and a consulate in Cebu. The American Business Center, which houses the Foreign Commercial Service and the Foreign Agricultural Service, is located in Makati City.
